this is my all time favourite movie ever     i remember seeing this when i was younger and since then i have been in love with it  i used to rent it so often from this one video store that used to carry it  and when we moved i couldn t find it any where so i kep going back tot he far away store just so i could watch the movie again   finally i found it for sale and i bought it and watched it over and over again     great movie   since then though it was my very first dvd that i got after i got my dvd player    ok well i got them at the same time  the quality on the dvd is way better i couldn t believe it  you gotta see this one,1,
committed stars  heather graham  along with  casey affleck  and  luke wilson   its the story of joline who is determined to find her ex husband who is in the process of a mid life crisis    committed was not at all what i expected it was lacking in comedy which was ultimately the genre  it was beyond stupid and un realistic  casey affleck delivered a reasonable performance  graham s recent roles have been lack luster and this is not an improvement   graham s most recent role was blessed which i also found misleading and didn t appeal to me at all   pros affleck  cons predictable  unrealistic  poor acting and not a comedy movie,0,
it s not really about wine  no  nossiter s real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate the peculiarities of local  wine  production for business purposes  to this end he has made an excellent  objective film  spirited  bumptious  emotional and flawed independent wine producers are juxtaposed with media finessed  anodynesprech amercians and auld europeans  the art of wine making against market driven  laboratorised product manufacture  it s an open show that doesn t lead conclusion   nossiter s film is occasionally infuriating to watch   cameras are neither concealed  nor steadicam  by any means  there are also plenty of captions as well as subtitles to wade through  often too short a time on screen   however it does outdo michael moore at the game moore can t play anyway  the characters speak for   and therefore condemn   themselves  well worth a viewing,1,
i tend to be inclined towards movies about people who choose to cross the barriers of censorship  and express what they really want to express  eric bogosian s character of barry is like howard stern  but much more intelligent  the character itself is very fascinating  as an oliver stone film  i guess i was expecting more  the film sags a bit during the third act  plus  it s pretty obvious that  talk radio  is based on a play  with its long dialogue scenes  but overall  the film works  bogosian is great in the lead  and the fact that he also wrote the play from which the movie was based on probably helped him  if you want to check out one of stone s greater films  i better suggest you check out  jfk  or  salvador   this is not his best work  but a good movie nonetheless,1,
strike force or  the librarians  is a fun action movie that doesn t it take itself too seriously  william forsythe stars as simon  who is looking for a missing daughter of a wealthy client  he meets up with sandi  erika eleniak  who is also looking for someone her sister  but there are evil bad guys afoot  the most evil of them all is marcos canarious  andrew divoff   marcos likes to kill people  so now  simon and sandi have to team up to bring down the villains  the whole cast is great  with divoff stealing the movie  there are also cameos by ed lauter and burt reynolds  if you are looking for a good action film  watch this and have a good time,1,
ok  when i rented this several years ago i had the worst expectations  yes  the acting isn t great  and the picture itself looks dated  but as i sat there  a strange thing happened  i started to like it  the action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump  brion james  maybe one of the greatest b grade actors next to bruce campbell  is great as always  the story isn t bad either  now i wouldn t rush out and buy it  but you won t waste your time at least watching this good b grade post apocalyptic western,1,
the only reason i saw this movie was because it had giovanni ribisi and it was supposed to be  horror   don t be fooled  this movie has to be the worst  horror  film i have seen  it s about these people who go to a secret location which has a  monster  in it  the monster is a man with a deformed face running around in blue sweat pants who has a craving for brains  some people die  some people don t  in the end they throw the monster off of a plane and then fly away happily  but oh no  the monster is still alive after falling out of a plane  go spend   hours some other way like watching paint dry on a wall  trust me  it s more entertaining than this crap,0,
this is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it  that would be fine if the film were a travelogue  but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry  that is not good enough  the theme of inter species respect and co operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter species love  but its approach is stereotypical  indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species  as with many films  one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter  alas  we probably will never know,1,
great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in    years  great production design  appealing stars  great lines   miss bender  i don t care if you beat it out on a native drum    says joan crawford s amanda farrow to hope lange when lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time   if you ve seen this movie panned and scanned on tv and not in the letterboxed version on pay tv or amc  american movie classics  you haven t really seen it  hopefully  this guilty pleasure of a film will be made available soon on dvd in a letterboxed version and with it s original   track stereophonic soundtrack  great opening title sequence that really catches the mood of      new york while johnny mathis sings the  best of everything  theme song in an echo chamber surrounded by a chorus of violins and another chorus of background screamers  miscarriages  insanity  office romance  bitchy cold hearted bosses  thwarted love  it s all here to enjoy,1,
christopher nolan s directorial debut is a memorable one  the film was very well received and help land contracts for making  memento  and quite rightfully so    following is an exquisite example of how films should be made  no fancy effects or blood dripping gore   just brilliant writing and good acting  nolan manages to captivate us once again with his writing  the actors  all unknowns to me and i suppose most people  did a good job bringing the characters to live  they were all believable and that s all they need to be  the film is confusing because it plays with chronology a lot but it s very rewarding in the end  the film s a little short to be a full length feature but any additional length would ve ruined the style of the movie and the brilliance of the writing would ve been diminished  though short  the film has every aspect that makes a film attractive  imo   an intriguing beginning  an exciting middle and a surprising end    i dare say following is almost as good as memento  his best film by far  the scrambled chronology is equally masterful used in both films  the amazing plot twists are present and the acting is very good   this film was made with a mere       but the quality is much higher than most  almost all  million dollar box office hits  the use of b w may be a hard pill to swallow for the big audience  following is primarily nolan showing off his skills to the studio bosses      and what skills they are   rarely have i enjoyed writing so much as in  following   even pi doesn t even come close imo  though it s also very good   this is a film surely not to be missed by any self respecting movie lover  if you liked memento   following  is definitely for you,1,
if you are home on a weekend  very bored and lack the will to move  with absolutely nothing better to do with your life for the next couple of hours you could enjoy making fun of this movie  the acting and script and general movie making of this film isn t actually all that bad  which is why it makes it possible to actually sit through this  this is defitnly a movie they would show in high school health class to teach the dangers of pre marital sex  or they could also show it to teach the dangers of very lame music   that  rock  band brian austin green is in is really terrible  i think thats a much greater threat to society than unwed parents,0,
it s not as good as the movie  that said it s a cute kids show  okay so the emperor has back slide and become a selfish spoiled brat once more  accept it and enjoy the cartoon as something entertaining  it has plenty of jokes for the parents and still holds the attention of children  also it boasts two of the original voice actors from the movie  earth kitt who has been in numerous films but i m sure many people know as catwoman  and patrick walburton  sorry if i misspelled  who also has appeared in many films and tv series but is most widely recognized as the tick  it s really a rare and wonderful combination  if for no other reason i highly recommend comic book fans watch at least one episode just to enjoy the dynamic duo  to sum up  entertaining children s show  with plenty of inside jokes for the grown ups to laugh along with  if your looking for educational value this isn t your show  if your just looking for something funny this is a great saturday morning pick,1,
i enjoyed the film  and the fact that it aimed rather high in dealing with some sophisticated material  i saw the film in a preview screening  and it wasn t ruined by any silly video boxes that spoiled the ending  the performances were quite good  especially andrew mccarthy in a more mature roll  i also enjoyed the look of the film which gave it a mysterious  forboding air  i also enjoyed some of the  twists  in the plot  and don t want to give too much away in case other countries  video boxes don t give it all away  the script was a little over the top at times  but i appreciated the fact that the film makers weren t afraid to challenge the audiences with interesting and puzzling questisons regarding the roll of faith in our world  and  while some might find the ending a little too open ended  i appreciated the fact that the movie refused to tie everything up neatly with a bow  that s not how life works,1,
alfred hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own      british film   the man who knew too much   this      take on the same story is much lighter than the previous one  mr  hitchcock was lucky in having collaborators that went with him from one film to the next  thus keeping a standard in his work  robert burks did an excellent job with the cinematography and george tomasini s editing shows his talent  ultimately  bernard herrmann is seen conducting at the magnificent royal albert hall in london at the climax of the picture   james stewart was an actor that worked well with mr  hitchcock  in this version  he plays a doctor from indiana on vacation with his wife and son  when we meet him  they are on their way to marrakesh in one local bus and the intrigue begins  his wife is the lovely doris day at her best  she had been a well known singer before her marriage and now is the perfect wife and mother  the film has some good supporting cast  brenda debanzie  bernard miles  daniel gelin  alan mowbray  among others  do a great job in portraying their characters   although this is a  light hitchcock   one can t dismiss it as a failure   the man who knew too much  is a change of pace for hitchcock s fans,1,
my family and i normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made  they lack the depth  and just not worth our time   the trailer of  nasaan ka man  caught my attention  my daughter in law s and daughter s so we took time out to watch it this afternoon  the movie exceeded our expectations  the cinematography was very good  the story beautiful and the acting awesome  jericho rosales was really very good  so s claudine barretto  the fact that i despised diether ocampo proves he was effective at his role  i have never been this touched  moved and affected by a local movie before  imagine a cynic like me dabbing my eyes at the end of the movie  congratulations to star cinema   way to go  jericho and claudine,1,
the lovely  yet lethal alexandra  stunning statuesque blonde beauty stacie randall  who looks absolutely smashing in a tight black leather outfit  must find a magic amulet so her evil demonic master faust can cross over into our dimension  it s up to fearless  rugged cop jonathan graves  likable peter liapis  to stop her  meanwhile  two pitifully unfunny  comic relief  dwarf gnome creatures run amok in los angeles  seasoned veteran schlock exploitation expert jim wynorski relates the supremely inane story at a brisk pace and takes none of this foolishness remotely seriously  the cast struggle gamely with the silly material  the adorable barbara alyn woods as sassy  fetching police captain kate  raquel krelle as tart  sexy hooker jeanine  bobby di cicco as graves  bumbling  excitable partner scotty  peggy trentini as alluring museum curator monica  and ace mask as the jolly dr  rochelle  mark stevi s puerile cookie cutter script  an amusingly lowbrow sense of no brainer humor  chuck cirino s bouncy cornball score  the two dwarf guys sporting obvious cheap rubber halloween masks  j e  bash s plain cinematography  no tension or gratuitous female nudity to speak of  and the tacky  less than  special effects all further enhance the overall delicious cheesiness of this prime slice of celluloid velveeta  an entertainingly brainless piece of lovably lousy dreck,1,
one of the two best films of the year  a well filmed  well written  well put together film with an outstanding cast  lau ching wan and his friends  dayo wong chi wa  anthony wong chau sun  francis ng chun yu  jordan chan siu chun  cheung man tat  had great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances  theresa lee plays her comedic role well  though much like a female version of michael wong  her gag seems to be the foreign born chinese surrounded by native hkers    and i found myself cheering for innovative explosive scenes  something i haven t done since    the fan boys took over alt asian movies and    john woo s hardboiled  sure the ending was expected  but i feel better cheering for cops than a bunch of young gang members  highly enjoyable,1,
when commenting on this film  one must realise that it is based on a true story  and must therefore be reviewed for the quality and accuracy of it s portrayal of the events  as well as its entertainment value  it may well be implausible that jack shepherd should surrender twice to jack wild because wild had captured edgeworth bess  none the less  it happened  it must also be noted that the director was young and inexperienced  which explains why he relied upon tried and tested techniques  there were occasions when clavell did not have the confidence to follow the script as written  the film would be better if he had  and yes  i used to have a copy of the script  stanley baker s copy   one of five   which i returned recently to my father  rafe newhouse  the writer,1,
i somehow managed to make it all the way through this movie  but was dumbfounded by the complete lack of entertainment delivered  my friends and i are fans of hk film  but wow  this movie has it all  and by all i mean everything a movie shouldn t have  underdeveloped and stereotyped characters  way over the top overacting  cheesy special effects  talking robots  no less than    double foot jumpkicks  impossible situations  unfunny  gags  and  jokes   elementary school premise  mindless killings  and too long running time for the material  throw in the fact that gen x cops was a decent film and this movie becomes even harder to bear  quite simply  if you re entertaining the idea of watching this film   don t,0,
holy cow  what a piece of sh t this movie is  i didn t how these filmmakers could take a     word book and turn it into a movie  i guess they didn t know either  i don t remember any farting or belching in the book  do you   they took this all times childrens classic  added some farting  belching and sexual inuindo  and prostituted it into a kaka joke  this should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like  i have to say  visually it was interesting  but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor  if you even think that kind of thing is funny  i don t want the kids that i know to think it is   don t take your kids to see  don t rent the dvd  i hope the ghost of doctor suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie,0,
i do not find this show at all funny  i actually think it is much worse than any of the other terrible disney channel sit coms right now  charlotte arnold is an interesting choice to play sadie  because she can t act  the jokes on this show are terribly unfunny  and it makes it even worse when the only cast member that has a little bit  and i mean little bit  of acting talent is justin bradley as sadie s brother hal  jasmine richards and michael d ascenzo portray sadie s friends  there both really stupid and just terrible actors  two words that can really describe this show is terribly corny  it s corny humor that only little girls find funny because their brains have not developed yet  now i ve explained my hatred for the acting and the horrible humor  what s next  the whole premise of the show is a stupid idea  she changed again  not so sciencey an ben loving  and suddenly nobody recognizes her  it s moronic  in summation  i hate this show  however little girls who do not have a concept of funny will enjoy it  so i guess that s what they re going for over quality  although i can say as much as  the first season is clearly better than the second   bottom line  just don t watch any of it   my rating  awful show  tv g     mins,0,
after all these years  of peter o tool s brilliant  costly giving of his soul  film after film  at last  hollywood tosses him an oscar recently   country dance showed up one night late  and of course  blew me out of my complainant niche in my alleged  life   how does he do it   york again also is brilliant in this kind of play  both psychological battleships loaded for bear      bravo to author  director  cast  and camera crew  no wonder the nazi s lost to these irish  scot  english blends    brutal honesty hurts   back in the    s  when i personally believed  honesty  was pure and absolutely vital to trust  i have modified my edgy extremes  and will settle for more human  warm flaws within myself and others   forgiveness allows humanity to have a reverse gear  and allows us to fix our own bull headed egos and erotic mistakes,1,
this is a great example of very none hollywood film making which is very thought provoking  moving and not without a sense of humor  kevin mckidd and paula sage are superb    i actually watched it on late night tv and i can see why i missed it in the cinema  its not the sort of film that the multi screen  mega  cinemas show nowadays  mores the pity    i am going to look for the dvd  not for those who prefer  the current trend towards special effects and no story  if you liked the best selling book  the curious incident of the dog in the night time   you ll enjoy this film    this film ranks beside the best of scottish films  such as  small faces  and  trainspotting   all films which kevin mckidd also star in    highly recommended,1,
this film  winning im kwon taek the best director at cannes in       tied with p t  anderson for punch drunk love   is about a   th century korean painter with a commoner s roots and significant impact on korean painting  one of the strengths of the film is that im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter  so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend  jang seung up  choi min shik   receive inspiration   the costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good  it s not a movie that moved me  but it was one that made me think about art and what it means to find your own voice in it  that s pretty cool  it s also interesting to see a version of korea during those times right before the turn of the century  where chinese and japanese powers are both in korea and the chosun kingdom is coming to an end  more than one revolution and political ideology are gathered in the film  but are never the center  it s firmly on the painter   in the end  it s a well made film about the life of a painter  but it doesn t exactly have the regular three act structure plot  so you have to be able to take a non standard hollywood story to watch it  yay for art,1,
wow  we watched this film in the hopes that it would have at least some decent rock climbing scenes  we were disappointed there  but it was still a great movie  it was soooo cheesy it was great  i haven t laughed so hard at a movie in a long time  if you are into rock climbing  and you enjoy cheesy movies  then this one is absolutely for you,1,
it s supposed to have got good reviews  says the g f  if so  i can t find them  she goes off to sleep and i endure  michael douglas as a good ol  boy   now there s a new one  matt dillon all screwed up  john goodman losing his cool  paul reiser running around in bdsm leather  oh it s a riot all right   the hitch is you re probably going to lose interest pretty soon on  liv tyler plays the femme fatale and critics complain she might not have the register for her part  but it s immaterial  this movie is not about character development  in fact i d go so far as to say there s no character at all  what you re supposed to appreciate here is the plot   no one is  bad  in this movie  some people wonder why all these  stars    reba s even in here for goodness sake   sign up for such a junky project  odds are they thought it would be fun  maybe they did have fun  who knows  hey   maybe they got paid good too   but you have to fork over money one way or another to see this turkey  and that s probably not a good idea,0,
loved today s show    it was a variety and not solely cooking  which would have been great too   very stimulating and captivating  always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next  she is as down to earth and as personable as you get  like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable  special guests  who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too  loved the  first  theme and that the audience was invited to play along too  i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things  but she did it and by golly i ll be writing those recipes down  saving time in the kitchen means more time with family  those who haven t tuned in yet  find out what channel and the time  i assure you that you won t be disappointed,1,
submerged is definitely not  the worst movie ever   it does have its flaws  such as borrowed footage  crazy script and non existent special effects  these are the worst   but it also has some good points too  the acting is surprisingly good  there are lots of familiar faces whom you probably know if u re a b movie fan like me   i was very glad to see brent huff playing one of the heroes  knowing him mostly for his    s action films  and i must admit  he is not a bad actor at all  fred williamson  maxwell caulfield   tim thomerson get some limited screen time  but are believable in their parts  the  eye candies  in this fred olen ray movie are yvette nipar and nicole eggert  both looking very sexy and very mean  michael bailey smith adds some muscle to the background as a navy seal  unfortunately the only cast member who  in my opinion  is completely out of place is coolio  he doesn t act at all  talks like he didn t even read the script  and being a badass in the beginning of the movie  gets shot like a wimp a hour later  not a good choice   to sum this movie up   this is not such a bad choice for late night entertainment  if you can get over the special effects thing  so many guns  so much fire  and not a single wound on anyone   coolio s annoying performance  and the recycled footage from airport     you might like this no brainer after all,0,
two years after its initial release  goldeneye still sits atop the field of first person shooters for the nintendo     even the quake and turok series have not had the combination of graphic detail  sound quality  enemy intelligence  challenge and overall fun that bring me back to this game over and over again  the missions each have specific objectives that force you to think as bond  not just to shoot up every baddie that pops up on your screen  but also to avoid cameras  disable security systems  rescue hostages  protect the bond girl  and so on  q gadgets abound in this game  including the famous watch  the game is loosely based on the movie storyline  including all the major characters and the best scenes of the movie  from the dam bungee jump to the prop plane escape to the tank chase through st  petersburg  even the layout is preserved where possible  so you ll recognize various situations if you ve seen the film  other levels are added to challenge the player and string together the scenes a little more  with each difficulty level the mission objectives are more difficult  the enemies smarter and the bullets more lethal  i still have not gotten through the    agent levels  cheats can be opened  not by entering codes or pushing buttons  but by completing certain levels within a certain time frame  and additional characters can be opened up for the multiplayer  the multiplayer is still the best among the first person shooters  it s not as crisp as turok but it doesn t slow down nearly as much    tons of options give your friends reason to blow each other up over and over again  and one more time just for kicks  there are better games for the n    such as zelda and all things star wars  but rare has continued their streak of outstanding games with a first person shooter that has not and will not be surpassed until they top themselves in      with perfect dark,1,
i have always been a huge fan of  homicide  life on the street  so when i heard there was a reunion movie coming up  i couldn t wait   let me just say  i was not disappointed at all  it was one of the most powerful   hours of television i ve ever seen  it was great to see everyone back again  but the biggest pleasure of all was to have andre braugher back  because the relationship between pembleton and bayliss was always the strongest part of an all together great show,1,
exceptional movie that handles a theme of great proportions with a very well balanced direction  dmytrik was a very good director  at least from what i can tell from this movie and murder my sweet but he was seriously affected by the huac as other movie directors and actors  it is in a way ironic that crossfire received no oscars  because it is exquisite example of how to make a great film on low budget  everything about this movie is exceptional  a well written script that makes use of extensive flashbacks  a great cast  superb lighting that seems to tell the story more than the actions proper  what more can you expect from a top notch movie  might i add that noir is here used for its stylishness  and i might add financial advantages  but this proves once more that what was originally deemed a b movie can have more impact today that most of the heavy handed a movies that lost their audience with the passage of time   this film is not a noir movie per se and this rises serious questions about what noir actually is  the style is definitely noir  in terms of sets and especially lights but the theme surpasses the recipe of the  noir genre   you can see things from the opposite perspective and claim that anti semitism is only a pretext for the criminal investigation  the puzzle around the murder being the actual focus  this would have been the case had it not been for robert ryan in an outstanding performance  either way  the movie has a lot to offer and it is truly a pity that the director had to suffer so much iniquity for his former beliefs in a really  noir  period of america,1,
this film is my favorite comedy of all time and i have seen a lot of comedies first of all i should not this film had no script just a storyboard the dialogue is almost completely written by the actors which makes this film absolutely hsyterical the cast is one of the best comedic ensemble s you will ever see the story is about the mayflower dog show in philadelphia and some of the contestants in them parker posey shines and is absolutely great this is one of those films that most of the laughing comes from the absolute pathetic ness of the characters,1,
where to start with  speck  the true story of richard speck  a killer of eight nurses in the     s  director keith walley has worked on a few of the extremely low budget full moon releasing movies  such as birth rite  and here works from a script by  at the time  full moon regular don adams  unfortunaly whilst the film seems like a accurate portrayal of the horrendous crime the script isn t great  perhaps because the real speck s ramblings were not terribly interesting   despite the care that has been taken to make this authentic it wreaks of a cheap cash in of the acclaimed cinematic serial killer movies of the same period  such as  ed gein    filmed in a dirty brown  not quite sepia  for the most part and narrated by star doug cole the film fails to present the horror of the crime because the narration is irritating  the colouring distracting from the story and the crime  though gruesome and upsetting to watch  is merely that and no editorial work seems to have occurred on what is pretty much a very poor quality camcorder viewing on the events  there is no examination of the motivation or of speck s life really  just a cheap shot at a gruesome crime  released by full moon there is little evidence of full moon s better output here  charles band ignoring his own rule that his films feature fantasy killings  e g  dolls  monsters and so on  and not quite knowing what to do with this new reality  incidentally band introduced a special label for these films called  shadow entertainment   band has said that he regrets the period of full moon output alongside tempe entertainment  whose creator j r  bookwalter and regular danny draven also speak very badly of charles band   the tempe era features uniform apple mac editing and brutal hand held camera filming  very much like a home movie  speck retains these qualities and whereas witchouse    for example  managed to use these well  speck is merely boring and gross,0,
what is wrong with curacao   also known as deadly currents though what the reasonn for the name change is i have no idea   can probably be summed up where a woman says to her lover      keep it down baby   i m trying to sleep     it s not the dialogue that s the problem or the way it s delivered   it s the fact the actress has has a central european accent   nothing wrong with that until it s revealed her character is from philidelphia in the united states   this what struck me about this thriller while watching it   the way accents don t match their characters   apart from the philly woman with a german accent we see a south african with an english accent   a local police chief who sounds like he s an irishman impersonating a gestapo officer and worst of all george c scott playing someone who s either dutch or british with an accent that sounds like it might be american tinged with south african   you soon give up following what s on screen and end up concentrating on what nationality a character might be due to the strange way they speak   it s interesting to note that this site hasn t given this movie a country of origin   with so many different actors from different countries you do feel that this was produced by the united nations   even if you re not curious about accents or dialects you ll probably have to give up following the action anyway because curacao is plot less   things happen like a boat exploding   and a hostage situation and the hero being recruited as an agent for south african intelligence but you re left scratching your head wondering what the heck this is all leading to   i was lost,0,
it s a horror story alright  but perhaps not as you know it  the real monsters in this flick are humans  while the monsters  are human and prey  as weird as that may sound i see this as  monsters inc  for horror film fans   sure  the effects are of a std horror film  the monsters are there as in any monster based film  the gore is there as well  there even is a slasher in the shape of dr decker  played by david cronenberg  i see flash of cillian murphy as dr  jonathan crane in batman begins here   or is it the other way round    and it is decker  c who are the bad guys  the monsters want mainly to mind their own business  warding off intrusive humans more or less misguided  wanting to join there society   by the end of the film you actually grow to like the quite little monsters  and the dog    not perhaps what you had expected from the first few scenes,1,
i love das boot  i hoped for something along similar lines    a realistic war movie  portraying soliders and civilians on both sides as real people  with both the joy and pain of combat   unfortunately  stalingrad appears to have been written by a third grader and directed by a fifth grade student  major pieces of the movie simply appear missing  leaving it completely disjointed  the dialogue in translation is ridiculous  but appears no better in the native tongue  you only have to watch the actors  faces during the bad moments of dialogue to realize just how bad this movie is,0,
from reading the back of the box my first thought was that this is probably a knock off of saw    i couldn t be further from the truth  it seemed to me like they gave somebody with downsyndrom a camera phone and        and told them to make a movie  the plot didn t exist and neither did the acting  it was almost as if i was watching a silent film about grass growing  it didn t surprise me at all to find out later that the entire film was  improvised   by the end of this  film  i had lost the will to live and i may have gotten aids just from viewing this piece of cinematic crap  it was about    minutes that i could have spent doing something that was less painful  like jumping off of a building,0,
if you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing entertaining  then you re bound to enjoy surveillance  this film was garbage for both the mind and spirit  the notion that this is a  thriller  is comical  that would imply some kind of tension and twists  you kept waiting for the story to actually finish  starting   it never rises above a glorification of weak minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life  picture all of the violence of  no country for old men  without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters  thrill killers run amok  the acting is good  mostly  but the script is a pile  don t bother  and tell your friends to don t bother,0,
text taken from      melbourne international film fest guide   fuckland the title is a pun based on the film s lead actor fabian stratas  deliberate mispronunciation of falkland  a reference to the film s setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist   fabian is an argentine national  an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the falklands soon after it is reopened to its people  his master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females  commencing with the delicious camilla thus siring an entire generation of half argentinians  fuckland creates the illusion of a documentary and maintains a fish eyed perspective that gives the film a voyeuristic flair and intimacy   argentina,1,
ok  so this film may not have won any oscars  but it is not a bad film  the original  d o a   is undoubtedly a better film  but that does not mean this film is bad   the film stars dennis quaid in one of his early roles  when he was first becoming really famous  after  the right stuff  made him a star  and a very lovely looking meg ryan  when she was still now quite famous   this is more of an  update  of the      film  rather than a remake  since the setting is different and the characters too  are different  the plot is pretty much the same  a man  this time an english professor at the university of texas at austin  is poisoned and he has only    hours to find out who poisoned him and why  meg ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him  jane kaczmarek plays quaid s estranged wife  in a low key  but intense performance  she steals every scene she is in  daniel stern  also in an early role  before  home alone  made him famous  plays quaid s colleague  charlotte rampling is fine too in a supporting role   the entire cast is top notch  the film is stylish  with a quick pace that keeps you guessing until the end    i think this is a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller  and as a modern version of a classic film,1,
cover girl is the best musical rita hayworth ever made  ms  hayworth will always be remembered for  gilda   however  the next movie would be  cover girl   the story is great  it is about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it big in show business  she does it without the help of her talented dancer director boyfriend  gene kelly   mr  kelly is given the chance to choreograph the musical numbers  the dances are spectacular  it is fun to see phil silvers  a comic  do the musical numbers with ms  hayworth and mr  kelly    the supporting cast is perfect  lee bowman is given a chance to be an interesting third wheel  the other boyfriend,1,
i remember watching this when it was made and thinking it was brilliant at the time  watching it for the second time nearly    years later  i still think traffik is brilliant and much better than the us film that was based on this drama   it should also be watched by all our come today gone tomorrow politicians who think they can win the war on drugs  as the issues raised in this film are as pertinent today as they were back then at the end of the   s  and unless they change their policies  will be so in another    years   well written  well made  beautifully acted and superbly filmed  a thought provoking drama that entertains as well as brings to light some of the hard realities of the criminal drug trade,1,
i am sorry to see that surface has not been picked up for the nbc           season  i guess market demand for inane game and reality shows on broadcast television  a reflection on our sense of culture  has conquered a good story  i hope and pray that some network picks it up so it will continue on as does stargate and it s spin offs   i also hope the producers find a venue where they can produce the level of post production they wished for in a tv guide interview  right now the reruns on sci fi  marathons  will have to do  i for one would love to see where the story goes after the tsunami that ended episode     i would like to find out the mastermind of the efficient effort to obfuscate the real identity of the creatures   fyc morningbear,1,
directed by e  elias merhige  begotten  is an experiment with a few interesting ideas that don t quite succeed in what they were trying to do  the film is a    minute ultra slow  questionably effective  irritating experience that tries to present an intriguing philosophy about the creation of the earth and human nature   it opens with god presented as a chair bound psychopathic man who tears open his stomach using a knife  from the guts  blood and human waste mother nature emerges  she proceeds to impregnate herself with the dead god s semen  later she gives birth to the son of the earth  a retard who is constantly abused a group of cannibalistic people whom i believe to be the representation of mankind    begotten  takes a twisted and disturbing look on the origin of life  demonstrating the self destructive nature  violence  lust and greed that have become a trademark for mankind  the problem in the movie come from two points  one is that the film is just too slow in it s exhibition  what we get is a good thirty minutes spent on showing how the son of the earth is constantly shaking naked on the ground while at the same time being molested and tortured by mankind  such tasteless prolonging gets boring pretty fast and lacks the punch in delivering a blow to the viewer s senses   another point is  beggoten s  visual appearance and sound  the grainy  inverted  black and white low frame cinematography enchants the disturbing factor of the plot  but such novelties often work in only short periods of time  then gradually begin to lose their effect as the audience becomes accustomed to the look  the audio suffers from the same problems  it s constant repetitive and similar sounds become annoying so fast i had an urge to turn off the volume   begotten  loses it s charm shortly after it begins  it tries to be original and creative but it fails to expand on the ideas hinted by the vague plot instead it repeats the same scene again and again   the conclusion is that  begotten  is stuck in one moment  even though plot wise it tries to move forward  the visuals and audio remain the same throughout  showing the same action in a slightly different way with just slightly a different sound  a gimmick cannot alone make a movie  it also needs pace and variety  something merhige seems to have forgotten,0,
i loved that the mood was light and airy  i loved that the lead character wanted guarantees about his future  and that his roommate sets him  straight  of all people  i loved that they tackled the dynamics of how the members in the men s group dealt with each other  considering this was directed by a lesbian the whole theme of masculinity was put out there  ridiculed  dissected and questioned  what makes a man  what makes one straight  gay  or bisexual  you aren t really sure if our lead character has decided on who he really wants  he s living in the moment and thrown caution to the wind  these  and other reasons  make me love this film,1,
there s a spartan  unsentimental edge to this film that allows plenty of room for us to participate in the action without any stylistic encumbrance telling us how we re meant to be feeling  in  blue   everything was overtly sad  sure  powerful as hell  but still   in  white   it was delightful whimsy  but there are no such emotional clues  or cues for that matter  in this one  it s as if he finally let the force of the tale work its own magic without razzle dazzle embelishment  i think that s what makes it the most initially enigmatic of the three  but finally  the most transcendent and redemptive  never has remorseless  unsparing honesty been quite so beautiful,1,
spoiler warning  we ve all heard the  boy who cried wolf  legend  but what if the wolf was a person in the modern world  well it might be something like big fat liar  fourteen year old jason sheperd   frankie muniz from  malcolm in the middle    is always lying to keep himself out of trouble  one day he is pressured to write an english essay  but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film maker marty wolf   paul giamatti   who plans to turn jason s story into a hollywood blockbuster  no one believes jason when he for once tells the truth and he ends up in summer school  however jason is determined to prove to his parents the truth and travels to l a  with his friend kaylee   amanda bynes    when wolf refuses to admit he ripped off his story  jason plans to make wolf s life a living hell  b f l  is no masterpiece but it s a nice way to spend    minutes of you re time  i wished they could ve made it a bit longer though and there aren t that much pranks although they are clever enough   i like the pool dye the best    i might not have liked this as much as i do if it weren t for paul giamatti  he is simply hilarious in this  if you have    minutes to kill try this out  you might just enjoy it,1,
i hate vampire movies  with that said  this one was very interesting to me  i do want to point out one thing tho   bakjwi  literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories  you see count dracula or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or wuheva  we also know that bats are mammals that can fly thus many categorizes them to be  exceptional   as i watched the film  i realized that the theme of bat is deeply embedded in this movie more than just to make the bat vampire connection   duality of human nature   if you ever read aesop s fables  there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just can t seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage  mammals and birds find out what this bat has been doing and banish the bat out of their lands at the end of the story   the two contradicting sides of human nature are constantly at battle throughout the film ex  sang hyun s blind priest friend  sang hyun s effort to quench thirst and his sexual desire  tae ju playing both sides  her ordinary boring life vs  her thrill seeking vampire adventure  etc  won t ruin too much  u have to watch the film  and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious sides of romance  sex  violence  religion  dark comedy tragedy  vengeance  you name it   i feel like many would find this movie boring and too long  but this film is very fresh and new  something that i haven t seen b  yet  i wouldn t say this is cw park s best work  but it is mos  def  the strangest to comprehend yet darkly intriguing,1,
the comic strip featured actors from  the young one s    a student based sitcom from the    s  comic strip features included parodies of westerns   the famous     and the professionals   all a lot funnier than this  having said that alexei sayle puts in a good turn as a traffic cop with ambition and the soundtrack features great music from the era,0,
well  what can i say  what the f  k  there really isn t much to say about this  really  the only way you would like this is if u  like me  like bad bad horror to laugh at   acting  very unconvincing  just watch the last scene with the main actresses running  rip off of texas chainsaw massacre  but in a bad way  just awful   gore  really not believable  in one scene they use one of those knives which have a chunk cut out of them which fit over a body part etc  by using this with the addition of red ketchup  its supposed   look real  although it really doesn t   plot  predictable  kids get lost in woods on camping weekend  movie ripped off from friday the   th   killer quality  scary mask if you re scared of clowns  kinda unbelievable that someone would chose this as their costume however  the director obviously realised all the good costumes had been used in all the other horror camp movies out there   total               p s  stay away from camp blood ii  that one made this look like lord of the rings,0,
if we could have  separate tables   why not  separate lies    this becomes somewhat involved  a housekeeper s husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle  the culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for  the latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred  to complicate matters further  the housekeeper once worked for the guy s parents and he had her jailed for stealing  therefore  people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident  sounds like she wants revenge   this all becomes convoluted  when our housekeeper discovers that her boss was driving the car  she recants her testimony much to the dismay of the officer who is working on the case   as if this isn t enough  several months later  our lover  rupert everett  becomes terminally ill and our lady  emily watson  leaves her husband  tom wilkinson  to care for him   the acting is quite good here despite the never ending  peyton place  like theme  tom wilkinson  is a solicitor  who tries to protect his wife   the film is a good one  but we could have done without the terminal illness  o well  the marriage ended anyway,1,
it s less visceral than the only other tsai film i ve seen   vive l amour    but the idea of doorways  holes  into others  emotions and existences is vividly portrayed here  as tsai sets up long shot after long shot  usually with long takes  suggesting a sense of alienation in taipei  the musical interludes  inspired by grace chang  are perplexing but welcome mile markers that add new dimensions to the slowly evolving relationship between the young man upstairs and the woman downstairs  it s not necessarily an easy film to watch  although it s not heavy handed by any means   so i d warn any casual viewers who are looking for some  indie  entertainment  like tarantino or guy ritchie   but if you d like to know something about isolation among city dwellers in taiwan  and something more universal about city alienation and romantic yearning  then watch this film immediately,1,
words alone cannot describe the sheer beauty and power of this film   think  toy story   now  think  toy story   circa       now  imagine the animation looks as lifelike  as fluid  think of the movie not as something adults and children can enjoy  but imagine it as a filme noire   imagine trying to do something like that back in       somehow   the mascot  delivers  in a story where toys come to life  and one of them is trying to deliver an orange to his sick owner  starewicz delivers a level of animation completely unexpected  it s so fluid  you will wonder for a long time whether what you see is really stop motion animation    comparing  toy story  and  the mascot  is an excercise in futility  plot wise  while  toy story  is a children s story adults can enjoy   the mascot  is a dark  chilling story aimed at adults  meaning  no  your kids won t like it  one bit   still  get it if you can  you might be able to find it along  vampyr  in dvd and laserdisc  and prepare to be stunned at what starewicz was able to do back in      with a couple of puppets,1,
probably the biggest thing about wild rebels that hurts it the most is the hero  he s got loser written all over him  but that doesn t stop him from  getting the girl   probably one of the world s worst race drivers imaginable  he decides to stop racing after he crashes his car  well  his new job is racing still  as a bunch of biker types pick him to drive their getaway car as they commit crimes  there s nothing really to endear you to rod  even the situation he s thrown into is pretty stupid  in the end  at the lighthouse scene  you ll wish that rod gets killed with all the bikers  get this  he s shot twice  once in the arm and once in the leg  and still manages to crawl up the stairs a little  if only jeeter had better aim     avoid this one unless you re watching the mst k version,0,
the movie was slow  the dialogue between actors actresses felt  flat  and basically there was no development of the characters in the story   omar epps skulks around with a mad look on his face the entire time  pouting and basically looking annoyed with everybody  danes has no on screen magic  and ribisi s character is a goober that nobody would want to hang out with even if they were paid to do so   throw in the weird scene where epps has to dance with an old man  and you have what quite possibly could be the worst movie in cinema history   i watched it on satellite  thank goodness i didn t pay for it   and wished i hadn t   do yourself a favor and go sort your underwear and socks drawer if you need something to do but are tempted to watch this movie when if it comes on your tv  awful movie if you ask me  and i generally have something good to say about just about any movie out there,0,
edge vs  michaels boring in general  loved the sweet chin music into the chair       taker vs  heidenreich one of the worst matches i ve seen  predictable as hell      tripe threat wwe match why do i watch them  nobody ever wins a championship at the rumble  its not the main event  liked it when show drove jbl through the wall       world heavyweight championship pretty ok match  kind of more a beat down by tripe h than a match  but i was happy to see it after watching crap       royal rumble good rumble liked the brand showdown the hassan thing  and the end       overall still crap  why does anyone watch the rumble,0,
tourist trap is a genuinely spooky low budget horror film that will surely satisfy horror fans it contains extremely strange atmosphere and there are some quite unnerving moments of total dread and fear some scenes are downright bizarre for example there is one scene when chuck connors sits down to have dinner with a mannequin that comes to life and starts conversing with him before its head falls off there is very little gore but the violence is quite strong for pg rated horror film the mannequins look very sinister and the climax is horrifying david schmoeller returned to make several other genre films including  crawlspace   puppet master  and  netherworld  still  tourist trap  is definitely his best horror film so if you want to be scared give this little gem a look   rated pg for brief nudity  violence and profanity,1,
you get this stupid excuse of a child s play rip off  man  what were they thinking  first they mess with a rumpelstiltskin horror movie then they make crap like this  fariy tale haters  well to be honest  i ve seen this as a kid  and it scared me a bit a lot  simply because i was under aged with the assumption that pinocchio wouldn t do that  wah wah wah  but i ve grown and come to think of this as child s play rip  a fairy tale bashing nonsense  and a lame tales from the crypt episode  or trying to be one at least  with a lame ending that was stupid  and it had many plot holes  and i still can t understand how it came to life  was it the work of an evil geppetto  then what  after a few evil deeds  he becomes a real boy who becomes america s most wanted  personally  i think the concept of an evil geppetto sounds better  he builds an army of wooden killers  and starts a crime wave  funny  but this is awful  awful  awful  awful  awful  awful  stinky like a shoe  and awful  it sucked it sucked  if you want killer puppets  settle for the killer doll  specifically child s play  instead  no strings attached  or if you want a fairy tale figure turned upside down  watch leprechaun  or if you want pinocchio  watch the animated disnet version or live version with jonathan taylor thomas and martin landau instead               negative,0,
i absolutely love promised land  the first episode that i saw  was while i was on my mission from            i really loved the rich family background portrayed in the show  here was a family with struggles of their own  but instead of dwelling on them  they would reach out with love to others who may have had the same problems  in an effort to forget themselves  and go to work  this is what caused me to fall in love with the show  all of the actors  especially gerald mcraney  had demonstrated the true meaning of  family  which has left an indelible mark on my life  i have been down the same road they have  but it has taken allot of time for me to develop that kind of character  i love this show so much  that i have wanted to share it with friends  but i was really stunned when i had heard that it was taken off the air  i thought and still think they should bring it back  so many lives can benefit from heaven inspired media  i honestly believe that this show was divinely inspired  because it brings the spirit every time i see just one episode  this show really  in my book  has truly defined what a  promised land  is  it is the love that you hold in your heart for others  which brings you to a higher destination  the spirit of love  is one of the most potent messages in this series  and all i can say is  bring it back   robert,1,
the most remarkable thing about  talk radio  is how bad it is  the callers  voices all have a phony  reading from a script ring to them  an evening with an annoying loudmouth at a dallas radio station is told with the portentousness of a sartrean glimpse into hell  stone tries for an existential revelation and gets unintended comedy instead  whenever a caller makes a  profound   empty  point about something  stone shoves the camera at one of his character s face as they are stricken with some traumatic realization that is never revealed to the audience  bogosian overacts throughout in one of the most irritating performances ever smeared onto celluloid  underrated classic  give me a break,0,
for late   s cheese  this really isn t so bad  there are a lot of pretty funny throwaway one liners   that was grand theft      thanks    and madonna gives a fine performance  nothing award worthy here  but that goes for razzies as well as oscars  i m curious to know if the movie would have been better received if she had used her regular  pre british influenced  speaking voice rather than the hyper bronxy accent used instead  oh well  as a side note  i got to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops through my work  he said that it was a fun film to work on but gave me the sad news that the actor who played buck the ups delivery guy died about a year after who s that girl,1,
well  great costumes and a wonderful  feel  for pre wwii italy  but what happened here    great actors   kristin scott thomas  sean penn  anne bancroft  james fox  derek jacobi    if you can t get memorable performances out of this  a list  then the problem with this movie must be blamed on pitiful direction and an inadequate script  i rented this on dvd after having liked  angels   insects         also directed by philip haas    yipes  i can hardly believe how dull this thing was  it just dragged on and on and no one was able to save the poor thing  this is not even a good intriguing foreign dudes and young things in  pretty clothes chick flick    tea with mussolini  gone amuck,0,
i totally loved this movie  tried to buy it and can t find it  a must see  a movie you can watch again and again  funny but also a tear jerker in one  really good album for the movie  it s a really good    s movie  i wish i could find a copy to buy this movie  cause i would the actors in it acted really good there s a lot of people out there that probably could relate to this movie that s what makes this movie so good  so go out and try to rent this one  you won t regret it  it s an older movie but it s worth watching  i would not be surprised if they made a remake of this movie soon  but i m sure it would not be the same  anyone who hasn t seen it  go rent it,1,
just saw the film tonight in a preview and it s a film for kids only  it does not improve or add to the original disney film in any way  there is a corny scottish pastiche style throughout  not helped by weak writing  where motives are lumped in by the spadeful  and acting that is uneven and often unengaging  despite what reads like a decent cast   i have no problem with the wee dog   although there is a certain  skippy the bush kangaroo   see below  quality about his shots     for those that don t know   skippy  was an australian kids  tv series from the     s where the kangaroo would be an essential part of all the stories  it is said that to get poor old skippy to  act  they stuck an elastic band round his muzzle that he then tried to get off with his paws   sort of appearing to be communicating with the human actors    bobby has a similar range and you just don t buy his series of heroic rescues at all   advice would be to take kids aged       below that  they might be scared  above that  if they or you love it  good luck to you  but this is strictly cardboard cut out film making for the undemanding  it s a missed opportunity since there is real pathos and cuteness in the story of bobby and this film fails to deliver it,0,
stars  danny devito  billy crystal  anne ramsey  kim griest  kate mulgrew  oprah winfrey and rob reiner   after college class  teacher larry  crystal  wants his ex wife dead and owen  devito  wants his momma  ramsey  dead  when larry brings up that he wants his wife dead  owen knows what he must do for him  in order for a favor in return  for larry to kill his mother  devito is absolutely hilarious in this as the brain dead wannabe writer that has daydreams of poisoning his mom and sticking scissors through her head  he has a child like role that makes him seem more of a confused man than a killer  ramesy was actually nominated for an academy award for this because of her wonderful performance as mean old mrs  lift  along with having comedy  the film also has heart  one scene between devito and crystal starts off seemingly as a joke  but goes deeper  actually making me slightly sad  danny devito directed the film and did a good job getting the dark tone in to his direction  for any fan of comedies i recommend this   my rating  b plus     mins  pg    for language  sexuality and violence,1,
i want the    minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie  the acting was horrific  i used to be a fan of cameron diaz and vincent d onofrio  i will never look at them the same again  keanu reeves and dan aykroyd were not a surprise  everyone knows they never could act  thankfully  only dan attempted an accent  his accent was a disaster as expected  i think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from minnesota  i hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time  the only reason i was able to sit through the whole movie was because i was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read,0,
bit of a curate s egg  this one  i started off hating it  with it s predictable  old dark house  set up  it s constant references to recent us horrors and regular trips up and down dimly lit corridors   but it does get going and has it s moments of originality   i began to wonder   once the killing started  how they were going to last out with only a cast of six but then we get flashbacks to a previous visit to the building and see a whole slew of gory killings which is pretty effective   naschy is fine and by the end it s been an enjoyable enough movie  it just does not jump up and grab one  hard enough,1,
this is a wonderful comedy short  one of keaton s absolute best  through a long series of silly mistakes  buster is mistaken for a wanted killer  and  as a result  most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular  while generally i am not a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes  this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability  i have seen some that have had wilder stunts  but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace  in particular  there is a scene where he runs across a table  jumps on a man s shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible  plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed  such as how he really comes to believe that he s actually killed someone  by the way  this film is very similar to cops  also by keaton  but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing   this film is brilliant and the only keaton short i can think of that i probably liked even more was the playhouse  where buster plays every role at the theater,1,
this film was different  it took a sort of typical thriller story and reached for a more interesting  in depth look at an individual character s struggle with faith  of course  it helped that the main performance  by andrew mccarthy  was quite excellent  the other performances were also quite interesting  although not as consistent  the ending was a bit of a let down  but there were lots of good moments  the film makers tried something different here    they didn t just go for the obvious chills and scares  this is a dark film  not for everyone  but if you want to be entertained and not talked down to  try this one,1,
this is a very very very bad movie    the plot is weak the acting is bad and the science is worse   the special effects are unconvincing  the dramatic scenes are a joke  every step of the way you can see coming a mile away  the end is disappointing and there is no suspense  the best aspect of the film is the soundtrack   the only reason not to give this a lower vote is because it is a tv movie and i believe the budget was low to start of with   i do believe that the young female fans of luke parry will still see this movie however he has done better work  again this is terrible  very very very terrible  if you have a choice  look at something else,0,
it s too kind to call this a  fictionalized  account of the barker gang  they got the names right  but that s about it   russell is still hot  i ll grant you that  but this is not the real ma barker  who basically took care of the boys by cooking and assisting when they moved around the country  not by planning or participating in the crimes  i think it would have been far more interesting to present the real story of a middle aged woman caught up in the criminal activities of her children and their cronies   i also have to agree with those reviewers who found the shoot out scenes to be totally unbelievable  the barker karpis victims were a combination of the innocent and of the law enforcement agents who pursued them  but they definitely did not mow down half a dozen fbi agents every time they were cornered   on the other hand  as several recent books have related  the fbi of that era emphasized the idea of agents coming only from legal or accounting backgrounds to the extent that many agents had very little law enforcement or firearms experience  they were not the well trained agents that we picture today     but the worst sin of all is that the movie is basically a bore  nobody changes  nobody grows  we know the end of the road is ahead  we just don t know which shoot out it will be   only for die hard russell fans,0,
this movie was horrible  if it had never been made the world would be a better place  come on  a flying wagon  what were they thinking  this was a sub par movie with a horrible hook  and i would like a written apology from the studio that produced this  along with some cookies to help repay me for the time i wasted on this crap fest that i can never get back  if you payed to see this movie  i am truly sorry because i watched it on tv on a sunday afternoon when i had nothing better to do and it pretty much ruined my whole week  a flying freaking wagon     and that s supposed to make up for having a horrible mother who cares more about her own screwed up needs than her children  no wonder they don t have enough sense to tell someone he is beating them  their mother teaches them nothing but that what she wants comes before everything else  absolutely horrible,0,
so well made  no cgi crap  has anyone else been on the  jumping crocs  tour of darwin s adelaide river before  black water was way realistic  rogue was a bit cringeworthy   thought the blonde chick was excellent in it   haven t really seen her before  and the other chick is a babe  she is always excellent    v  suspenseful   i would compare it to jaws over any other man eating animal flick    got the hole aussie thing down pat without going ott with struths and crikeys  as well    loved it,1,
robert altman  nicolas roeg  john luc goddard  you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy  these and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream  but created it  for those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera  how often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film  it is the mood that counts  this is what i believe the directors of these movies were doing  creating a contemporary mood for old operas  for the most part they succeed wonderfully  with all these operas  who is going to like them all  we could have used more beverly sills   finally  what is art  even opera  without a few naked women,1,
this is by far the worst movie ever made  i have no doubt  i have seen such crap as manos  space mutiny  and whatnot  and i can honestly tell you that they do not hold a candle to science crazed   science crazed has no discirnable plot  something about a guy making a woman pregnant via turkey baster  and the child born  hours  later is fully grown  and ready to kill  of course  being a newborn  it takes him about an hour to kill people  the director loops footage constantly  and takes about fifteen minutes to set up an awkward death  there is about a page of dialogue for the whole movie  however the dialogue arrives about a minute after it is spoken   sample scene  the monster is walking down a hall  we know this because there is about ten minutes of looped footage of his feet  in between loops  we are treated to two women working out  repeat ad nauseum for about    minutes  when the monster does show up  no one moves  and everyone looks like deer in headlights as the monster takes another    minutes to get to them to kill them  by the level of the acting  you would guess that the people are already dead   i know my description doesn t seem too bad  but trust me  i can not fully describe the pain that is science crazed   stay away  and boycott all video stores that carry it,0,
i m astonished how a filmmaker notorious for his political left wing fervor could make such a subtle  non sanctimonious picture  if you re for capital punishment  you ll still be for it after seeing this  if you re against capital punishment  you ll still be against it  but whatever your stance is  this movie will  at the very least  make you reflect on why you feel the way you do  there s not one false note in the film,1,
how his charter evolved as both man and ape was outstanding  not to mention the scenery of the film  christopher lambert was astonishing as lord of greystoke  christopher is the soul to this masterpiece  i became so enthrawled with his performance i could feel my heart pounding  the entireity of the movie still moves me to this day  his portrayal of john was oscar worthy  as he should have been nominated for it,1,
when i see a movie  i usually seek entertainment  but of course if i know what genre the move is  then i will seek what it is meant to do  for example  if it is a deep film  i expect the film to rile thoughts up in my cranium and make me ponder what it is saying  but who s that girl  is not a deep film  but it is entertaining  nonetheless  it s a campy sort of film that s a joy to watch  there s barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts  i ve watched it when i was younger  the cast is always entertaining as usual  i had a small crush on griffin dunne even though he wasn t the typical male heartthrob at the time  haviland morris also stars  and late austrian actress bibi besch is here too  overall  a delight,1,
this film has an excellent premise and is really crying out to be turned into a hollywood blockbuster  as i recall  and it s a few years since i ve seen the film  the action starts with a london omnibus filled with people  there is an horrific crash and one passenger dies  the rest of the film is then told in flashback  with    characters who were on the bus getting their recent lives explored in intricate detail  at the end of the film we return to the crash and find out which of these chirpy  vivid characters has met a gruesome end  great stuff  a little like a good tabloid news story fleshed out in precise  even handed detail  if only it were available on video,1,
the only good either of the problem child films caused was bringing together amy yasbeck and the late john ritter  aside from that  the flicks are as demonic as their hero  in this basically unnecessary sequel  freshly separated ben  ritter  and his little hellraiser junior  michael oliver  who never needs screen time ever again  move to a new town infested with willing bachelorettes  ben eventually picks lawanda  played by the most underused original snl er laraine newman   whose blanche dubois tendencies don t suit junior in the least  to add on to junior s torture  it seems this town already has a little firestarter in younger girl form with trixie  who coincidentally has a sweet  single mother played by yasbeck  the same actress who played junior s first horrible mother through adoption  you can see where the plot goes from here  searching for my favorite scene is like pulling teeth  so i guess i ll go with the  cherry bomb in the toilet  gag that makes back to the future s james tolkan one of the many grown up victims  that guy s always playing school authority figures   jack warden and gilbert gottfried return as their parts from the first film  but sadly  there is no appearance from the bow tie klansma  er  i mean killer  michael richards  that made problem child all the more fun  on a serious note  i m sure these films  whether abusive parents saw them or no  did wonders for the red headed children of america  let us also salute these proud american flicks for their terrific promoting of adoption  oh  and dog poop jokes   gotta have dog poop jokes     shmucks,0,
i have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it  despite the lack of excitement in the plot  the acting was very good by everyone involved  amy madigan played the part of a guilt ridden mother who is tired  yet well intentioned and determined to make up for her younger daughter s condition  yet  in the process  she has neglected her older sister  who is more interested in playing with her savant syndrome sibling and living in a world of escapism   the men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles  christopher lloyd  in a very understated role  shows us why he has such versatility  he plays a teacher who is dedicated to his profession and literature research  yet starved for a meaningful relationship  he and madigan connect very well in their scenes together  yet both know nothing more can come from their friendship  their wordless goodbye is nothing short of brilliant  an acting lesson for aspiring performers   and in a small role  fred savage is fun to watch   you can tell why this movie was based on a play  it s probably very good on stage  on screen  it s not particularly exciting  but it s nonetheless very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties,1,
anthony quinn was a legend of   th century in cinema by his great roles obtained this movie about a policeman innovated a false guilt for toni to rape his beauty wife  lisi  but he failed in this trap because he faced the strength of lisi but he succeeded in his trap which was prepared by him for toni that he put his name in the list of jewish people in romania and he transported from country to another in east europe   this movie was directed in      at the time of arab  isreeli war in       six days war  as an evidence of harmful works from jewish people which were caused by jewish people not only in europe but also in the rest continents   jewish people were a great cause of french revolution in        the pelchfik revolution in russia       the turmoil of different countries in any time   pearl buck wrote a novel  peony  in      at the time of occupied palasteine in      about chinese jewish people and their problems they faced in china because of their bad instruments they used in these countries as keys of crisis,1,
words can hardly describe what blue planet brought to life in all of its hours of runtime  matching up with walking with dinosaurs  this documentary stands as one of the best  we can only pray that the bbc and discovery channel come up with even more outstanding ideas that could possibly even level with this one,1,
this film is a very beautiful and slow film  there is nothing hollywood about it  it is very danish and the characters are very real  it is the first danish film to take up this transsexual theme  it is really about love that has no gender  i would not say it is about lesbian love even though the two main characters  the transsexual veronika and charlotte  are attracted to each other  it is a story about love and life   the story pretty much takes place in the two apartments  there is almost no background music  which makes it seem more real and intense  the two actors playing the main characters are great  they really make them seem real  they are not archetypes  but real people you could meet in the street  i think it is the first time i have seen a transsexual portrayed this well  very well done,1,
as a professional poker dealer for over    years i found this movie very hard to watch  too unreal  it seems the producers of this movie either had done little or no research or just didn t care  the card tricks are something you never would see performed in a real poker game  common sense right  plus it was full of film cuts and such during the tricks  who couldn t do that  the cheating was amateur stuff  palming  marked cards  etc  would you sit in a high limit game where they use opened deck cards  would you sit in a game where the players push their chips into the middle of a pot  constantly   mixing them in then just verbalizing how much they bet  c mon   i gave it a   because the twists and turns might be interesting to some people but for those who know how to play the game it will be pretty painful  next time they should use real players and get some insight on how to do it right  ouch,0,
purportedly made back to back with  erotic nights of the living dead  with the same cast and setting but for certain this one does not have laura gemser  much derided by all i rather like this movie  sure enough the storyline and dialogue are codswallop  but this is so beautifully filmed in such a marvellous setting and i actually like the hardcore  i find it at once naturalistic and exotic  and that doesn t just mean there is a black girl and some limp penises  i find the numerous and varied sex scenes very believable  even if two are set upon a tree trunk at the edge of the ocean with the waves constantly splashing around  the creature does not deign to appear until half hour before the end and is  it has to be said  a disappointment  still  in the time remaining he manages to kill off all but two of the expedition and in the case of the girls having sex with them first  or afterwards in at least one case   and this film is not as slow as some maintain  moreover there are some fine moments of sexploitation  not least the lady scientist and her urge for two  natives   and the glorious finale when the two survivors speed off in their boat  gaze back at the island they have escaped from  and find there is still time for one last act of copulation,1,
i found this robin williams vehicle mildly amusing at best i guess you would call it a political satire of sorts it s about a political talk show host comedian who decides to run for president and unexpectedly wins i found most of the humour dry myself and robin williams is much more restrained and sedate than usual i would say the movie is more of a drama than a comedy with a bit of mystery and suspense i think the dramatic parts worked better than the comedy parts and the mystery and suspense aspect though that s a small part of the movie worked the best still i wouldn t rate this movie very high for me it was an ok waste of   hours but nothing special my best advice would be to catch it on tv cable or rent it cheap first before making a decision on whether to purchase my vote for man of the year is a,0,
i believe it has been over    years since i saw this series  yet memory of it hasn t faded a bit  this would be a natural for dvd re issue  it seems to me  many of the performers have gone on to greater fame  robert hardy  sean connery  to name a couple   though it was a smallish role  i still remember judy dench  then in her    s  as katherine of france  henry v   she was very lovely then as now   there is a hint on this site that the series was filmed in color   is this so  who of us would know   virtually no color tv in those days  mores the pity  no vcr s  if so  some might have recorded it  as a way of teaching english history  this series made it come alive in ways few class room teachers can manage   what a fine re issue this would be,1,
what gives this movie its personality is the knowledge  in the end  that it is all true  while it is a compelling and humorous documentary that does border on mockumentary in some parts  are they staged or is it really happening humorously    it does seem to get a bit long towards the end   this movie is funny in places it needs to be  and flows relatively well  reminiscent of christopher guest s movies  if you liked those or adaptation then i recommend you keep a look out for this one   b,1,
i thought the movie was good  but i like to read the real story behind the  based on a true story  movies  does anyone know the names and locations of the real characters the movie is based on  i have done a complete internet search and cannot find any information on this case  all i get is the movie information and the fact that it is based on a  true story   i find it hard to believe that a judge would change his sentence rendered immediately in the courtroom  even after such a heartfelt speech by the brother  gorgeous john corbett   but overall the story was very gripping  anyway  if anyone knows the real  real story   i would appreciate you sharing it,1,
i think together all the reviewers have captured this film really well  i have seen it many  many times  but i still feel a sense of joy and warmth just as i did the first time  my emotional response to this film never seems to fade  the final scene certainly brings me to tears  but so does the scene between perks and the children on his birthday  and as for the kindly gentleman  something else is going on with that character  the generous provider and solver of problems  he knows everything about everything and has connections everywhere  a perfect father to run to and make us feel safe  i do not know how the film does it  but it touches something very english deep inside  which has long gone from our daily experience  but yet we all instantly recognise and yearn for again,1,
a man arrives in a strange  beautiful  sterile city where no one feels any emotion and obsesses instead about interior design  the essential sameness of his days is reminiscent of  groundhog day   the strange passages in and out of this world more remind one of  being john malkovich   but truly  this is a scandanavian movie  a piece of self satire that is also scandanavian in style  the tone is austere  and even the most fantastic scenes are played straight  daring you to laugh at the absurdity  to my mind  the combination isn t wholly successful  there aren t enough genuine laughs to compensate for the difficulties of taking the piece as pure drama  it certainly is original  perhaps my problem is that the world that it satirises is not one that i recognise  perhaps i should move to scandanavia,1,
now maybe it had something to do with the fact that i saw this movie at a low point in my life  when i was really trying to figure out where i was going and what i needed to make myself happy  but this film really spoke to me  jane is an everywoman  although she has so many positive things going for her  she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life  she is strong and intelligent  but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a second choice life  she seeks out new challenges and happiness  seeking desperately to fill the hole in her heart  dreya weber is an exquisite jane  as we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair  the torture of her desperation and  eventually  the strength of her conviction  the beautiful addie yungmee is also very well cast and an asset to the production  allison mackie is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable timing  i highly recommend this film  although it s low budget  it has big budget writing and production values  ps  great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women  women will love the story and characters  but there s something for the men here  too,1,
george c  scott gives his finest and funniest with wonderful drama as well in this paddy chayefsky screenplay  diana rigg is attractive and quite the complicated young woman  this film veers between tragedy and chaos in a new york hospital of the late    s with staggering consequences  barnard hughes is delightful as always  great stage actor as well    an   out of     best performance   george c  scott  chayesfsky was a big blow hard when he put down vanessa redgrave at the      oscar ceremony  but he s a good writer  a truly ensemble cast that works wonders  down to the smallest role  this won best script at oscars and scott was nominated  he should have won for this instead of patton the year before  which he was also brilliant in   seek this out,1,
while i agree completely with drvn below about mary mccormack flopping a milk bag out on tv  the rest of the show is fantastic  phil hartman was great in a professorly way  teaching the celebs the ins and outs  foley s a nut  but in a good way  you never know what self depricating humor he s going to come up with next  as for the game play  it s entertaining  filled with witty banter  and great for any newbie that may have even a passing an interest in the game  too bad it isn t on anymore    i just checked the schedule all the way to august and it doesn t appear to be scheduled for any time in the future  bad bravo  you deserve a beating,1,
this is a fabulous film    the plot is a good yarn  and is imaginatively told in a series of flashbacks and alternative points of view  what was deliberate  and what was coincidence  who is in love with who    you get the chance to put yourselves in the shoes of each of the characters in turn  sometimes literally   and this helps define each character to a satisfying depth    with a bit of effort following the twists and turns  you can understand each of the characters  and key events in the film are reshot from the point of view of different people    take the opportunity if it comes again to your arthouse cinema  it looks good on the big screen    more than keeping you guessing  the plot twists to such an extent that you just sit and watch what unfolds   i defy anyone to predict    but more likely you will need more than one viewing   i saw this at the pictures on its original release three times  and it got better each time    the acting was very good  with a standout performance by romane bohringer as alice torn in three directions by the three other characters in the ensemble    a classic  the second best film of the     s,1,
well don t expect anything deep an meaningful  most of the fight scenes are pretty decent  the two leading ladies are quite endearing but their lack of hk action background shows at times  the ending maybe lacks something but i quite enjoyed it none the less  the cheesy humour isn t probably going to appeal to anyone who hasn t watched a bunch of hk films but if your down with that sort of thing and have a couple of hours to fill with something meaningless you could do a lot worse than this   ok so you could do better but          certainly on a par with most of the hollywood blockbuster action drivel,1,
this is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art  this is an oblivious labour of love by the schrader brothers about the life of yukio mishima that is full truly artistic elements  the movie jumps from color to black and white  past to present  fictional works by mishima to him  all without being confusing in the least bit  the only thing that gets me is that the entire movie  with the exception of the narrator s spoken parts is in japanese  still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but hasn t found won  criterion  if you are reading this  this is a film that should be released under your imprint with as much extras as possible  this film truley deserves more,1,
did the first travesty actually make money  this is another sequel  along the lines of another stakeout  that no one asked for  but we ve received it anyway  the sequel is like its predecessor  completely brain dead  it s also pretty disgusting  remember the dinner scene   to think i almost felt sorry for ritter  yasbeck  and warden  did they need the money that much,0,
poor shirley maclaine tries hard to lend some gravitas to this mawkish  gag inducing  feel good  movie  but she s trampled by the run away sentimentality of a film that s not the least bit grounded in reality   this was directed by curtis hanson  did he have a lobotomy since we last heard from him  hanson can do effective drama sprinkled with comedy  as evidenced by  wonder boys   so i don t know what happened to him here  this is the kind of movie that doesn t want to accept that life is messy and fussy  and that neat  tidy endings  however implausible they might be  might make for a nice closing shot  but come across as utterly phony if the people watching the film have been through anything remotely like what the characters in the film go through   my wife and i made a game of calling out the plot points before they occurred    e g   the old man s going to teach her to read and then drop dead   bingo  this is one of those movies where the characters give little speeches summarizing their emotional problems  making you wonder why they still have emotional problems if they re that aware of what s causing them  toni collette  a fine actress  by the way  and one of my favorites if not given a lot to work with here   gives a speech early on about why she buys so many shoes and never wears them  spelling out in flashing neon the film s awkward connecting motif  at that moment  i knew what i was in for  and the film was a downward spiral from there   grade  c,0,
an interesting look at the immigrant experience  told as a fable with some very weird imagery   i got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from sicily who traveled to america  i imagine much the same as my grandfather did at that time  travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships  i cannot imagine it was very comfortable  as shown in this film   laws restricting immigrants existed  i would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the mediterranean and africa  immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities  in the film  we see physical and mental exams  the latter because of the view that low intelligence is heritable  single women could not enter the country  on the presumption that they would become prostitutes  so most married single men already in the country  as arranged beforehand  at ellis island before entry   this is the story of a british immigrant  charlotte gainsbourg   who arranges to marry a poor sicilian  vincenzo amato   he is trying to get his family through with a son that is mute and a mother  aurora quattrocchi  that is considered feeble minded  she was fantastic in the role  by the way   you will also see character actor  vincent schiavelli  in his next to the last appearance  i don t know if his last film has been released  he plays a matchmaker  and is also very good   it was a strange  but enjoyable film  it s not for everyone  as i imagine those who don t have some interest in the immigrant experience would find it rather slow,1,
the worst wrestlemania ever   this had no must see bouts and many crap ones at that  this took place in las vegas and wwe made it s employees dress up like egyptian gods  they even changed howard finkels name to finkus maximus  which probably doesn t mean anything  the sight of seeing jim ross in that terrible gown still gives me nightmares to this day and i m    years old  so you could imagine it when i was   years old  bobby heenan was funny though   matches included the undertaker vs giant gonzales in a p ss poor match  the headshrinkers vs the steiner brothers in a useless match  doink vs crush in a comedy match and a boring match featuring razor ramon vs bob backlund  hulk hogan teamed up with brutus beefcake to battle money inc  you could clearly see hogan had a black eye  in storyline purposes ted dibiase and irs beat up hogan while he was playing poker or something like that in the casinos  which is a poor storyline  but in reality  macho man randy savage hit hogan because savage thinks he s like the hulk  no pun intended  no not the wrestler but the film character   the main event consisted of bret  hitman  hart facing off against yokozuna in a very boring main event match  mr fuji threw salt in the face of hart and yoko won  but not until hogan came down and squashed yoko in    seconds   overall grade   e,0,
americans next top model is the best reality show  i was entertained      percent of the time watching it i kept my eyes open the entire time   well  i did blink  it can be sad  funny  or addicting  mostly addicting  america s next top model  kept me wanting more and that s pretty much the point  it is also on more that one channel  sometimes it s on mtv other times it s not  i hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series  it s great for pretty much all ages so every can enjoy it      also  if you watched the show before  haven t you noticed that tyra has a different hair style each time in the judging room  she ll have it short and curly one week  and then long and straight the next,1,
i watched this last night for the first time in    years  it s bad  really bad  but it has enough hilariously awful moments  that it s worth watching  first of all  was it deliberate to make the boy being babysat completely effeminate  he even says to costello a la mae west  you fascinate me   as costello does a double take  god only knows what would have have happened if the babysitter had been a hunk  this kid would have seduced him in a heartbeat  then there s the principal male dancer  he is totally inept  roar with laughter as he leaps and prances with no talent whatsoever over the giant s grave during he never looked better in his life  the two romantic leads are zeros  wastes  abbott gets to sing one line and that was dubbed in by another singer  geez  i guess he couldn t even carry a tune  costello does manage to be charming in his i fear nothing number  and i guess very small children might like it  but there s not much to recommend it  but oh that seductive effeminate boy  that aspect alone blew me away  plus the fact the family accepted anyone off the street with no references to babysit a child  today  little femmy boy would be taken away from them,0,
this movie has a lot to recommend it  the paintings  the music  and david hewlett s naked butt are all gorgeous  the plot  a story of redemption  forgiveness  and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching    and it s not predictable  which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age  but  the acting is mediocre  the direction is confusing  and the script is just odd  it often felt like it was trying to be a parody  but i never figured out what it was trying to be parody  of   and if it s not a parody  well  it remains a movie with great potential that it didn t live up to,1,
may contain spoilers   clearly  who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections  i just can t see it any other way  what really surprises me is no one used the name allen smithee  and more surprising  everyone involved didn t use this name   a,0,
this film  with only two characters  takes you closer to these two people  the interrogator and the prisoner  than most films take you to any character  however well crafted   the sheer confusion  terror and pain which madeleine stowe s character undergoes is deeply disturbing  as is alan rickman s sadistic yet charming interrogator   this film is all too possible  and builds to a shocking climax  the effect of the film as a whole leaving you sitting in silence at the end  it ll haunt you for a long time,1,
i debated quite a bit over what rating to give this one because it s my least favorite herschell gordon lewis film so far other than the gruesome twosome  but it has the best acting i ve seen in a lewis film  however  we all know that s not saying much  once the movie was done  i was happy because it felt like i had been sitting through a   hour movie  though it was only    minutes long  i m trying to see all of hgl s films and that s probably the only reason to see this one   the gore is good as usual  the one thing that herschell seemed to get right  the acting is just as bad as usual with one exception  that exception is frank kress  now  would i say that he s a good actor  no way  but he s good compared to everyone else  the story is boring and flat and goes no where and by the end  i didn t care what happened just so long as it ended  i know this is a cult classic but i didn t enjoy it very much at all  i hope you will,0,
the movie is incredible  it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie  the lines in the movie are great  such as  nothings to good for out friends  and  its collection time charlie collection time   i can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind  i feel that when i watch this movie i want to go out and shoot down bad guys  if there is a movie that you don t want to miss its this one   they killed the giggler man  they killed the giggler   they had no right in doing that  hes on our turf ill take care of it   the lines just keep on coming in the movie  deff  go out and not rent but buy this movie its worth the money trust me,1,
for this movie  based off of a tv show  and a serious finale  i thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious   m a s h goodbye  farewell  and amen  was pretty good  but not this one  unless you really love the series  like myself  skip this movie   i was a loyal fan of the show even stevens  but the plot was too gimmicky  and dave coulier  man  that guy hasn t done anything good   well  ever  they shouldn t have used tim meadows  he s a great actor  but he was too good for the script   i thought the movie was pure cheese  i would give it a,0,
this bittersweet slice of magic realism had a checkered production history  director writer replaced  and tanked at the box office  but it s a helluva film   elijah wood and joseph mazzello are pre teen brothers whose flaky mom  lorraine bracco  shacks up with a mean spirited alcoholic  adam baldwin   during his drinking bouts  baldwin physically abuses mazzello and manipulates him into remaining silent about his situation  but when wood cottons on to what s happening  the boys put their heads together and hatch a fantastique solution to mazzello s devastating dilemma   i love films that mix fantasy and dark reality  they are rarely successful financially   lawn dogs  is a similar example   but they are usually original and intriguing   the drunk baldwin is shot from a low  child s perspective and his head is deliberately lopped off below the top of frame  this device allows us to judge him purely by his actions and as a totally physicalized beast  both wood and mazzello are excellent  and they pull us effortlessly into their dark  frightening world   the  radio flyer  of the title is a small red wagon kids transport their belongings in  here it transports a dream   seriously interesting stuff,1,
yeah  there s a  sleeper  watching sleeper cell and it was me  after reading comparisons to       like on the cover of the dvd   i expected a fast paced action romp  but nope    this series just putts along  in my groggy half awake state i would think   he s gonna      and  poof  it would happen     guess that van is gonna roll off the      and there she goes   and so on   and why would darwyn  in extra deep cover  pursue a babe  could it be  perhaps  to provide a little t a  hey  that works for me  hence four stars rather than three   this show is no       i ve watched       sleeper cell  you re no,0,
i fail to understand why you would give this film anything over      fair enough it does take me back to the   s and to the  good old days of horror comedy  but that genre has not got any better since then   it is still so  lame low budget   low tech   bad acting   bad story line   not at all scary and not funny enough    in fact there is not much good i could say about it  the so called monsters are just hideously bad  i mean we have gone back in time to when they used to make the monsters out of plasticine and shoot the scenes fame by frame    i really fail to understand why someone would invest any money in order to make this script to a film   but i guess it might have been almost ok if it had been a bigger budget film   recommendation would be   please do not make the mistake of wasting your time on this unless if you wish to get tips for a bad halloween make up  personally i enjoy independent films and anything outside the box but this just did not do it for me in the least,0,
out of any category  this is one demented and over the edge film  even in todays standards  filmed entirely in crap o rama  this film will blow your mind  and something else too    the amount of hilarious bad taste and sleaze is astonishing  the dialog is breathtakingly fast and campy  you ll either love or hate this film  but give it go  i ve seen it   times and absolutely love it  divine is in the quest for being the filthiest person alive  but so are her rivals too in this obscene and disgusting  but funny  and stylish little film    divine was phenomenal  and  she  will always be missed greatly  edith massey does the unforgettable performance as the  egglady  and don t forget the energetic mink stole    ber crazy s  t    recommended also for you sick little puppies   female trouble   desperate living   polyester,1,
weird with unnecessary singing and backdrops  randomly much of the action will occur on stage giving the feeling of an opera performance  none of that explains why this is such a bad film   it s the impression that either not enough rehearsal took place or that no experienced choreographer was available  the acting is flat  even the sparkling ziyi zhang looks like she s just waiting for her next movement or line  you may notice the trivia on this site stating that she spent half a month in japan learning to sign and dance  read that again as   weeks and things begin to make sense  even worse are the little kids who seem to be looking at their parents at the back of the studio rather than at the camera   the cheap and cheerful sfx are just cheap and cheap  the editing is staccato chops peppered with slices of just nothing that adds to anything except annoyance  just imagine all the silly dance scenes from the recent zatoichi   particularly the closing routine   performed by your local high school drama club with one famous actress who speaks in another language  but you get her in simply because she s so good normally despite being unsuitable   recorded on a cheap camera and then edited into three times its length in no artful order,0,
the whole world is falling prey to a lethal disease  and rain never stops pouring down   nevertheless  in this atmosphere of nightmare  a man and a woman discover that they are neighbors  thanks to a hole in the floor of the man s apartment  they fall in love   at least  all would not have been lost  although this wonderful film expresses the loneliness and the weakness of human being  there is also some room for hope  in the shiny singing scenes,1,
the primary plus for this movie is the combination of chris farley and david spade  this was the first film in which this comedy duo displayed their laurel and hardy esque brand of humor  farley s obvious physical comedy skill is perfectly augmented by spade s sarcastic take on every situation they find themselves in   this movie stands apart from other comedy movies  tommy boy ranks in with blues brothers as a comedic work whose individual scenes and bits stem from the plot  rather than serve to break up the storyline and give the film a disjointed feel as so many other comedic films do  thanks to excellent direction by sagal  every scene is tight and immediately foreshadows or acts out the story being told  he is as much to credit for the film s hilariousness as farley and spade are  the acting of dennehy  lowe  ackroyd  and many others  see the gas station attendant    miles from davenport  strengthen the film   the film warrants multiple viewings because there are many fine nuaces to the film that may be overshadowed by farley spade   i believe this film is very well made and is the funniest movie i have ever seen,1,
this is an ok early    s horror flick in which a young girl  meg tilly  is wanting to shed her  goody two shoes  image and becomes part of a girl gang called the sisters  their initiation for her consists of spending the night in a mausoleum  too bad the mausoleum is the  final  resting place of some psycho russian psychic and he s not quite dead yet  seems this guy was found in his apartment with lots of things stuck into the walls from his telekinetic target practice  plus there is a pile of young dead girls found in the closet  all proof that hitch hiking can be dangerous  so listen up girls  the daughter of this man  reymar  is rather distraught about her father s death and is confronted by a man that said he knew reymar and given a tape to listen too  her hubby  adam west  of batman fame  is there to laugh and scoff  and not much else  but it seems that perhaps reymar s daughter may also have some abilities that she doesn t realize  anyway  having deposited their unfortunate pledge at the mausoleum  the rest of the sisters take off to go get stuff  like masks  sheets  etc  to come back and scare the crap out of her  but little do they suspect what s going on and they get more than the crap scared out of them  for even in death reymar is kind of a busy guy and he s reanimating lots of corpses for entertainment  and it would also seem that he has a thing for jail bait  overall this is acceptable horror  nothing too intense but not terrible either  the dvd from media blasters also contains another version of the movie that s a rough cut  i guess  i only watched a little of it so i don t know how different it is from the theatrical release but from what i saw i guess it s a  warts and all  presentation    out of,1,
one of my favorites  as a child  growing up in the ny metro area in the late   s and early   s  i was often afforded the opportunity to visit nyc with my grandfather or father  as they conducted business there  the gritty  bustling  human  reality of that city  particularly in winter  have stayed with me    this film very aptly captures the stark  cold  matter of fact feel of the nyc winter season  while keenly exposing the underbelly of the region s infamous underworld of crime and policing  a great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture    and the car chase is simply amazing  at least on par with the one in  bullitt   and surpassing the chase in  the french connection   i can watch  time and again  as the suspension comes unstuck on that plymouth fury police cruiser barreling toward the gw bridge in pursuit  as it lurches into that sharp right curve  bouncing and scraping into oncoming traffic  the stunt driving coordinator for that scene did  bullitt  and  the french connection  as well as many other noatable movie chases  good acting  too  and a decent plot line  the musical score is edgy and compelling  and the cinematography and direction are top notch  a great  if underrated     s cop drama  a keeper  not out on dvd yet  though   comparable in style and content to  the french connection and super fly  early      s cop dramas set in the bleak nyc winter months,1,
there seem to be many fans of this movie here  but i found it boring  slow  meandering  and pointless  and i watch and enjoy plenty of art house and independent films  so i wasn t expecting an action movie  i didn t sympathize with either character  the guy from the countryside was a bad guest and didn t seem to be trying very hard to find a job  and his relative in istanbul was humorless and closed off emotionally    in an interview on the dvd  the director says that the movie is about a common situation in turkey   the person leaving in the countryside because there are no jobs and coming to istanbul and staying with relatives while trying to find work  that in itself is interesting  but the movie wasn t,0,
it s been over    years now but i still remember that this movie was the worst i ve ever seen  i would have thought that in this length of time something worse would have been filmed but i was mistaken  i just finished watching  starship troopers  and it came mighty close but it was still more entertaining than   poor cow,0,
fbi agents mulder and scully get assigned to probe the mystery of what happened to an arctic drilling team  in this early  x files  episode that david duchovny himself considers one of their first  rockin   episodes  it pays loving homage to the much lauded john carpenter      theatrical feature  the thing   and one can see the similarities  visually  color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a hellish quality  production design   art direction are especially impressive  the shots of the exterior of the arctic camp are so reminiscent of the earlier film as to automatically create feelings of deja vu for some viewers  naturally  our heroes are threatened by the weather  so the sound design  involving wind  evokes memories of  the thing    the culprit is an ancient worm that had been exposed to the team  once inside a host  it stimulates aggressive behavior  this allows the paranoia aspect to take full hold  and the way the script is set up we can t be too sure of who s infected and who s not  this gives rise to the inevitable scene of testing  this episode certainly works at portraying the way that tensions can cause breakdowns in groups  it even allows mulder and scully to have moments where they re not sure if they can trust each other   guest starring are a good small group of actors  xander berkeley  felicity huffman  and steve hytner as the scientists obliged to accompany mulder and scully on the mission  and jeff kober as the pilot who takes them to the camp  you can also see one time jason voorhees portrayer ken kirzinger as one of the ill fated original team members   incidentally  there s one direct link between  ice  and  the thing   art director graeme murray  who worked on both projects,1,
low budget  mostly no name actors      this is what a campy horror flick is supposed to be all about  these are the types of movies that kept me on the edge of my seat as a kid staying up too late to watch cable  if you liked the    s horror scene this is the movie for you,1,
this movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title  the movie was cool despite the fact  i hate new ones  all of the cast was awesome   it has great cast and an awesome plot   the main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder   neat eh  dennis quaid is the man who is  d o a  in other words dead on arrival  he finds help with his friends  but everyone is now a suspect  dennis s character has several hours to find out who poisoned him  the movie is quite fast and full of action  you can see two other big stars in meg ryan city of angels courage under fire  and daniel stern home alone  very bad things bushwhacked  in supporting roles in this awesome  cool remake of a classic movie,1,
better than the original   the gamers  dorkness rising  manages to pull off a funny comedy with good acting  fine special effects  and comedy that transcends the  gamer  knowledge base and do so on a low budget  i ve seen many low budget films that have been terrible and almost none that have been as good as their high budget counterparts  this film blows most mainstream movies away  parts are a bit weak  the bit with the pirates and ninjas  while funny  goes on a bit long without explanation and takes you out of the movie for a bit  but  overall  this is a very strong film   i m very happy to say that i bought this film as soon as i saw it and brought it home   any chance we can look forward to another feature gamers movie from these guys,1,
a stunning and thoughtful observation on modern life for youngsters in japan  like grains of sand delves into issues such as rape  homosexuality and pubescent angst in a subtle and significant way  it gives an insight in to the youth culture struggling to define itself outside of the bounds of their parent s generation  with it s strict conformity and facade  typical to japanese cinema  often what isn t said is more important that what is  so to those not versed in japanese film and culture  beware  it can seem dull and minimalistic  pretty much like every film to come out of japan bar mangas  if you don t know what to look for  i saw it for the first time when i was    and was what originally sparked my interest in japan  it s culture and language  considering i m now    and learning japanese with the intention of living there for   years  needless to say it s a powerful film  enjoy,1,
loved today s show    it was a variety and not solely cooking  which would have been great too   very stimulating and captivating  always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next  she is as down to earth and as personable as you get  like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable  special guests  who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too  loved the  first  theme and that the audience was invited to play along too  i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things  but she did it and by golly i ll be writing those recipes down  saving time in the kitchen means more time with family  those who haven t tuned in yet  find out what channel and the time  i assure you that you won t be disappointed,1,
i say remember where and when you saw this show because i believe if fox gives talk show a chance spike will be right up there with conan in a few years because like conan he is incredibly funny and seems to be just grateful at having his own show which adds to the humor   the funniest bits spike has had so far are the idiot paparatzi and comedy for stoners and if your not high and get cfs what does that say about you    in summary this show is funnier in    minutes than snl in an hour so lets hope talk show gets the attention it deserves such as an extra half hour  more money and a band,1,
flood  is a prime example of how throwing good actors and cgi at a film will do little to compensate for a rubbish script  the basic premise is fine  what if a freak storm threatened to send the sea straight over the thames flood barriers and engulf london so fast that most of the inhabitants would probably never get out in time  it s basically the new york segment of  the day after tomorrow   but that shouldn t make it any less of a film  however  the script just isn t there  it s merely functional  flat  and lacking in depth  great british talents like robert carlysle and david suchet to name but two do their level best with what they ve got  but their characters are two dimensional cyphers  like something out of an old marvel comic  and it d be frankly easier to turn back the tide  not that every actor gets let off the hook   tom courtenay seemed capable of only one emotion throughout the film  but then he wasn t given much of a challenge   i applaud any opportunity to see some non hollywood disaster flicks for a change  and i don t expect zillions of dollars spent on rendering ultra  realistic graphics  however there s no excuse for shonky writing   especially from a country that has produced some of the best science  fiction ever made on next to no budget at all  this is the kind of half  hearted b grade fluff the sci fi channel produces  and that s hardly a target to aim for  if like me you are such a fan of disaster films you re still tempted  do yourself a favour and watch it with some friends  better still  don t bother,0,
unfortunately  many great films on imdb such as this one have their scores  adjusted  by imdb  this is truly a fine and intriguing film by the accomplished director of bonnie and clyde  little big man  night moves  mickey one  and the chase   if you click in the user rating area  you ll see that the actual median for four friends is      however  imdb has  adjusted   dumbed down   the rating to       per imdb   imdb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages  various filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts at  vote stuffing  by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of it    the exact methods we use will not be disclosed  this should ensure that the policy remains effective   in other words  we won t disclose our methods  so you can t question how we arrived at the score  what a shame to see fine thought provoking films like four friends fare no better than lame formulaic comedies due to imdb s  filters,1,
bounty killer george hilton  smooth mexican bandit gilbert roland  who s great   and bank representative edd byrnes each try to outwit one another while searching for a large amount of gold from one of roland s train robberies that was hidden by a treacherous member of his gang   though not the greatest that the genre has to offer  it s still breezy enough with a lot of light hearted  action filled fun and a satisfying finale   any gun can play is mainly remembered for it s opening gag where george hilton easily guns down three outlaws resembling clint eastwood  lee van cleef  and django   the next year  hilton and roland were reunited alongside van heflin and klaus kinski in the highly recommended the ruthless four,1,
i recently rented this video after seeing  final ascent  by the same writer  i wasn t prepared for how intense this film would get  i found it engaging from start to finish  and was rooting for the teenagers to get away with their attempted crime  the ending was definitely disturbing with some of its implied violence  but well done  i highly recommend this picture,1,
ms aparna sen  the maker of mr   mrs iyer  directs this movie about a young girl s struggle to cope with her debilitating condition   meethi  konkona sen  has been an aloof kid ever since childhood and has shown signs of delusion  no one knows why  the dormant tendency however slips out of control  when the job assignment takes her to neighboring bihar where she s raped by some political goons  the resulting trauma also leads to episodes of manic depressive psychosis in addition to her schizophrenia  she careens out of control over the years  progressively getting worse and sinking deeper into her private  world    the juxtaposition of an  unsettled   divorced  elder sister and how her domineering ways make an already bad situation worse  is indicative of what a fine line there is between abnormal and  seemingly normal   ms sen also makes an excellent commentary on the social alienation of such individuals  social rehab is standard therapy along with all the deadly mind altering drugs  but what about the poor and the destitute  who re always left to fend for themselves and usually fall by the wayside   the romantic connection between dr kunal and anu was unnecessary  also the cafeteria scene where dr kunal explains to anu how real their world really is to them  was redundant  anu should already know all that  the english dialog is a bit awkward at times though the acting compensates for that  konkona and shabana prove that their reputation is every bit worth it  waheeda  rahul and shefali play their limited roles very well    extensive research seems to have been done about this illness  its very evident  but its not clear if mdp can coexist with schizophrenia in the same patient  side by side  also in the early part  dr kunal recommends e c t  shock therapy  while invalidating the fact that it doesn t work for schizophrenics  only for extreme mdp with suicidal tendencies and other forms of bipolar disorder   the ending of the remarkable story is suggestive of an unknown solution  maybe no solution   the movie could have ended on a nicer note  since worldwide the mentally ill can and do lead balanced and fruitful if not very fulfilling  lives under good medical care   nonetheless  its an excellent film made with extreme sensitivity to the subject  hats off to ms sen  no one in india could ve done it better,1,
the basic plot of this film has already been detailed in several other comments so i won t bother  i d like to first commend the producer  cast  directors and crew for creating a wonderfully engaging film on a meager    m budget  a small fraction of standard hollywood fare that doesn t look cheap  these people have a drive to make something new and entertaining while not spending a fortune doing it  this is essentially art for art s sake  i know  i know  some of you will decide that this is not art but something less and that s fine  i for one am glad that people like these will continue to put forth the time and effort for our benefit without expecting huge multimillion dollar payoffs   now to the criticism  i feel that the scenario presented is credible to a point  it s wonderful when everything works out and the hero heroine saves the day and all s well that ends well  what gets me is the blatant manipulation of events so that blind luck is responsible more than courage and strength   when lee was attacked but not severely injured  somehow she washed up on a mud bank right next to the dead guide  then  miraculously  his loaded revolver is still in his holster and it actually works  after some cleaning and fiddling   finally  when lee is attacked on the mud bank and jumps in the water  once again the croc fails to kill her  she ends up with her hand in his  her   mouth and manages to repeatedly pull the trigger  ultimately to blow the croc s brains out  literally    i came to the conclusion that having lee go hand to mouth with the croc was just a way to end the film with the human in triumph  based upon what i have seen  the croc s attack and continue to hold on until the prey stops struggling  croc s will spin around and around to dismember and drown the prey  that happened to the first   victims but not to lee  she had teeth marks but they were not deep   i think that the ending would have been better had the croc won  frankly  thereby proving his dominance of the mangrove  his territory for millions of years  but then  how many of us would have been upset or disappointed that the pretty girl didn t get out alive,1,
the box is why i originally picked up this movie and the back is why i rented it  but i soon learned that i had been duped  i had thought this movie would be something like a road trip eurotrip american pie deal  but i was wrong  this movie is one of the dumbest i ve seen in a long time  the unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disappoint you  the acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy  it appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building  go out and get eurotrip or road trip instead  i can t believe national lampoon put its name on this  don t buy it  don t rent it  don t waste   hours of your life on this,0,

michelle pfeiffer and matthew modine are a joy to watch in this screwball comedy  alec baldwin  who was an up and coming star when the film was made  is a hoot  dean stockwell  in a sendup of john gotti  is hysterical  but mercedes ruehl  as the paranoid and over the top connie steals the movie   jonathan demme  previously known for wacky comedies like  something wild  and  melvin and howard  proves once again that he is a genius  i was not surprised at all when he went on to win the oscar for directing  silence of the lambs   the performances he evokes from his actors in  married  are inspired  and the audience is taken along for a wild and wooly ride   one of the cutest  most endearing films of the    s  it stands head and shoulders above many of the satires of its era,1,
after an intriguing start  this little drama quickly descends into the ranks of sheer mediocrity  the start of the movie sees two women  heather graham and natasha gregson wagner  meet each other while waiting for their boyfriends to get home from their holidays  natasha gregson wagner is a lovely looking actress  and she plays louise  a cute girl whose beloved boyfriend is an all round entertainer  music  movies you name it  he does it  while she s telling the other girl  carla  heather graham  all about her wonderful boyfriend  it soon becomes apparent that the similarities between their two male friends are too much     and it s obvious that the two girls are dating the same guy  oh dear  enter robert downey jnr  the sleaze bag that has two girlfriends while some poor guy somewhere has to go without one  downey plays the sort of guy that the ladies like  but men find repulsively annoying  he is  basically  a mummy s boy  the worst kind too  on the phone ringing mother all the time  continually showering his girlfriends with ambitious  albeit empty  promises etc  it s enough to make a normal guy sick   the film knowingly rips off superior three way love triangle films such as jules et jim  this film doesn t work though  mostly due to the fact that it s story is so unbelievable  seriously  if two women had just found that they were dating the same guy   they wouldn t stick around to talk about it  another reason why it falls down is that it s just so turgid  there s no end of possibilities for the outcome of the situation that this movie presents  especially with the claustrophobia of setting it all in a small apartment  but all the movie does is get lost in masses of dialogue  badly written and poorly delivered dialogue  that is  the film is also massively overacted  it just isn t believable that people would act like they do in this film after finding themselves in this situation  robert downey jnr is one of the many things that is wasted in the film  with natural born killers  he proved that he could give brilliantly entertaining performances  and that is something that this movie could do with  the two females aren t wasted because nobody expected anything from them anyway  but downey could definitely have been better utilised  overall  a waste of time  don t bother  see jules et jim or natural born killers instead  that s my advice,0,
to surmise  this film involves two actors  caine and moran  trying to con a gangster  the plot is flimsy at best as several plot holes occur throughout  however this normally shouldn t matter as the comedy should carry a film like this  there are some genuinely funny bits  mostly provided by dylan moran   however  other times  there are long melodramatic scenes that fail to add anything to the movie  caine s character seemed overdone to me  especially at the start  he continually quotes shakespeare and acts like a pompous actor  one could say he was playing the part properly but the character seemed to me flat and unfunny  overall i would say see only if a fan of the actors involved  otherwise wait for video or tv,1,
this movie is truly amazing over the years i have acquired a taste for japanese monster movies and am well aware that early examples of this genre can be poor  however this one reaches a new low  as it follows the adventures of johnny sokko     a young boy who controls a giant robot  and his fight against the evil gargoyle gang  who seem to have an endless supply of horrid giant monsters at their disposal,0,
no real plot  no character development  no scorcese level direction  but seriously  were you really expecting any of this  the only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious  nearly on the same level as borat  sure  the ending drags a bit  but if borat s cameo didn t crack you up  you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys  sacha baron cohen is possibly the greatest comedian alive  and here he gets more laughs than jude law on a nude beach  i dare you not to laugh   if you can pull the ten foot pole out of your behind for an hour and a half and just enjoy some well timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character  see this stupid movie  you ll be glad you did  keep it real,1,
a great production  that should be revived rebroadcast  i doubt that it would be out of date  i d love to hear from anyone who knows whether videos exist of this series  or any other information about where it could be found or viewed,1,
this is a case where the script plays with the audience in a manner that serves only in extending this story to    minutes  story starts out in      where a young girl named faith  cameron diaz  travels to europe with her boyfriend wolf  christopher eccleston  but she dies under mysterious circumstances  then in      faith s sister phoebe  jordana brewster  decides to travel to europe as well and try and find out what happened to her sister  in france she looks up wolf who has stayed there and she wants him to help her retrace the steps her sister took and answer some questions  he is reluctant but decides to travel with her  along the way he fills in the gaps of the occurrences and tells phoebe that faith had joined up with the red army who are an extremist group that is involved in terrorism  phoebe and wolf engage in a romance and this complicates the trip to portugal where faith died  their is several things wrong with this film and it all has to do with the script  first  the romance between wolf and phoebe is all wrong and does nothing for the story  it rings completely false and comes across as forced  it seems weird that wolf would engage in a romance with his dead girlfriends sister  secondly  wolf knows completely what happened to faith but only lets out little chunks of information every    minutes or so  wolf will look at phoebe every    minutes and say   there is something i didn t tell you   gee  thanks a lot wolf  if wolf had come clean the first time he talked to phoebe then the film would have been over in about    minutes  another thing that bothered me was that i don t think this film recreated the      s at all  diaz wears hippie clothes but the time period just didn t ring true  i did enjoy a few things like the authentic locations where the film was shot  it is a very good looking film and the scenery is beautiful  the performances are all good especially by brewster and diaz  besides  the fast and the furious  i had never really seen brewster in anything  but after watching her performance in this film i came away very impressed  she s very good here and i hope better roles come her way  the script is told in a very contrived way and the film never comes across as believable,1,
i must not have seen the same movie as the one the comments refer to here  first  i think they should have serialized ghost story if they were going to film it at all  the truncated version they come up with was awful  i felt the performances were mannered and so much was left out of the story that the performances of such masters as astaire  douglas  houseman  and fairbanks seemed hammy  alice krige was superb as eva  though  craig wasson is a good actor but he was only adequate as the protagonist  the decision to cast patricia neal and to truncate her role was not a good one  imagine what anne bancroft would have done with that character  i blame the script  which was poor  the production values were dark and the pacing was slow  a disappointing  pedestrian effort   the book is one of the five greatest suspense horror novels of the   th century  imho  but the movie was disappointing  although a great introduction for krige,0,
what s the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season    here is my forecast     the hatch was indeed blown  but somehow everybody inside survived  buts lets see about that     the episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on desmonds boat by penny  now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted  the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission     after the destruction of the hatch  the island is not isolated any more  and other ships airplanes are going to arrive    the others are finally going to share their secret with us poor observers  was it actually confirmed that there are going to be   seasons of lost   cheers mike,1,
turning isherwood s somewhat dark and utterly brilliant novel into light comedic romp could easily have been a recipe for disaster  but somewhow it wasn t   the story moves at a zanily rapid pace and the black and white imagery is gorgeous  as are harvey and harris as they ham their way through a wacky weimar berlin  fun,1,
this film has a decidedly weird setting  taking place in a school that s really old to begin with but it certainly doesn t look like any sterile medical school environment  very gothic and atmospheric  as for the film itself  well  ok  the premise is a bit far fetched but hey  that s why we watch movies  isn t it  and it s less far fetched than some of the garbage that s out these days  that s for sure  medical students are experimenting with  short term  death  as in allowing themselves to be briefly dead so they can experience what the afterlife is like  it s kind of nice  in some cases  till parts of it come back with the voyager and start meddling in their earthbound lives  i hadn t seen this film in years till i got it on dvd and i have to say that i d forgotten just how good it was  and it struck me that julia roberts looks truly beautiful in this film  not like actresses of today that are supposedly gorgeous but are dressed and made up like cheap hookers  ahh  the good old days  anyway  this is a great flick  perhaps not for fundamentalist christians but many others may enjoy it    out of    stars,1,
in fact it was awful  the main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director at the time  it was shot at some warehouse most likely owned by family or friends  also they chose not to bother coming up with a story  sure these are ways to cut cost  but are they smart ways of keeping costs down  no they aren t  at the very least they could have found a middle school student in a  creative writing  course  those kids may have at least had a lesson about story structure  at the very least  they could have read up on   act structure but acting obviously wasn t a priority either  watching these jerks run around in funny clothing that was stupid by      s standards was an embarrassment  the fact that none of these actors committed suicide in humiliation is probably a testament to the limited distribution this film received  had the actors actually seen the final result of their hard work  there would have been a line of people waiting to jump off the brooklyn bridge   i d give this movie       stars but it only deserves   for being released at all  this movie should be shown to film students everywhere  it s better than     of student films i ve seen and wow is this movie a piece of shiiiit,0,
i actually liked certain things about this game  i loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games  there s nothing like seeing the monsters up close  in your face  the graphics really weren t bad  but i would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a shooter  the music was fine  the things i hated were  the movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total pain  the story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality  the inability to save was awful    some of us do have a life and would like to save to finish the game later  i thought the weapons kind of sucked  too  this game is fun for awhile  but it s nothing like the first three and only good if you just want to shoot stuff  i d recommend it for the novelty of playing in the first person  but that s about it  play it at your own risk,0,
i cannot see how anyone can say that this was a real good entertaining movie  with a few well known actors i found it hard to believe that this was only made in       it s crap  the acting is tantamount to amateur dramatics  poor amateur dramatics  unless you want to laugh loudly at an amazing     minutes of pure corn  don t bother to download it or rent it  worst that i have seen in years  it s from the bygone days of acting  where cowboys are shooting   bullets from the six shooters  the more well known the actor  the worse they were  drury was just sad  i was extremely disappointed with lee majors  has he actually stooped to this sort of garbage  it was bad enough when he played the six million dollar man,0,
i own this video as well as the concert version of the musical with patti lupone and george hearn with the san francisco symphony orchestra  george hearn is fantastic in my book as are angela lansbury and the composer  stephen sondheim  this musical is operatic in scope and shows much ingenuity in composition  i certainly hope that this vhs becomes available on dvd   hearn s performance is spookily sympathetic  the one annoying performance is the young woman who sings the role of joanna  i believe this performance was at the dorothy chandler pavilion in los angeles  rather than on a broadway stage and am not sure that the minimalist set was utilized in new york  as it was in this production  but i found the scaffolding being dragged across the stage to be quite effective to  portray  the streets of london  i highly recommend this movie,1,
this movie was advertised as a comedy but was far more serious than the trailers made it out to be  don t get me wrong  i enjoyed the movie  but was expecting more laughs  great performances from robin williams and laura linney  worth seeing  but don t go expecting to be rolling on the floor  the movie left me wondering what it would be like if robin williams character was a real person that was running for president  would we elect a comedian  i doubt it  unfortunately  that kind of stark honesty is something greatly lacking today  this is a movie that i will be adding to my dvd library as soon as it comes out on dvd  the movie has heart,1,
quite simply  goldeneye is the single greatest n   game to date  the learning curve is just about perfect  and you ll still be playing it with your friends months on  as the multiplayer mode is nothing short of exceptional   the system for acquiring cheats for once requires some degree of skill  rather than simply knowing which buttons to press  and the challenge of aztec on    agent level is astonishing   all in all   it s the best game i ve ever played on the n,1,
this is a wonderful look  you should pardon the pun  at    women talking about breasts   theirs  their mothers   other women s  and how they affect so many aspects of their lives  young girls  old women  and everyone in between  with all shapes  sizes  configurations  etc  talk about developing  reacting  celebrating  hiding  enhancing  or reducing their breasts   it s charming  delightful  sad  funny  and everything in between  intercut with documentary footage and clips from those famous old  young women s films  that the girls got taken to the cafeteria to see  the interviews are a fascinating window for men who love women   their breasts into what the other half has to say when they don t know you re listening,1,
well  the movie did turn out a lot better than i expected  it s not boring and it s not unoriginal  it s really not a silly romantic comedy  the situations the characters put themselves in are very unusual  of course  we re still talking about a movie  but the main characters are indeed plausible  donald is  of course  an exaggeration  but he s just a pawn in the movie  a means to prove something  the ending isn t one of those ridiculously happy  always the same  moral containing pieces of crap you can usually see in movies of the genre  i genuinely liked it and i m hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of movies  it s worth a watch  besides  it s better directed than other movies  the story line always stands up  the characters themselves stand up  and they do not experience this miraculous change and love is not revealed to them like a holly god given artifact  yada  yada  at the end of it all you actually see yourself going through it all  the movie makes you feel something  you may even learn a thing or two  it s not the usual hope producing  tissue moistening idiocy  it s a good movie  not a consolation prize for teary women around the world,1,
john leguizamo s  freak  is one of the funniest one man shows i ve ever seen  i recommend it to anyone  well  anyone with a good sense of humor,1,
when i found out there was a christmas vacation    i couldn t wait to buy the dvd  i sent off my money and watched it as soon as it came through the letter box  i love all the national lampoons films with chevy chase in it  and i bet he was glad he wasn t in this one   i couldn t believe how bad this was  you would think it was impossible not to laugh at a national lampoons film  but believe me it is    this film probably looked like a good idea on paper having cousin eddie as the main character  he started to get on my nerves from early on in the film  and became totally unfunny by the middle of the film  and by the end of the film i had gone brain dead and couldn t remember what had happened,0,
i watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was  i was looking forward to it after reading the plot  even though i find nirvana overrated   it sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that  jansen puts in little touches like the books  kubrick book among others   movie posters  etc  i like when i see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film  and you can really feel that in this  there are tons of scenes and moments that i love  i am trying to think now of some other films that are like this and i would say the only thing i can think of are cameron crowe films  takes little moments and makes them stand out and special  the soundtrack is amazing and each song works perfectly with the scenes and feel of the film  this film is amazingly shot  and the editing is outstanding  i could really go on and on about the film  i cannot recommend this enough really  if you want a fun story with great tunes from a director who clearly put his heart into his work then check this out,1,
a great performance by emily grace  i stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious by the summary of the plot giving by my satellite service provider  i was high entertained and had much compassion for the character  alice  played by emily grace  the story had me guessing in what would happen to alice and was not predicable  the overall story was refreshing and had some great twists to the supporting characters  the ending of the story ended on a rather fair way  i will purchase this dvd to add to my library  i am a new fan of emily grace and i high anticipate in seeing more from her performances,1,
jack black and kyle gass play fantasy versions of themselves in this comic showcase for their side band tenacious d  an art rock outfit with satirical  barbed lyrics  an ex runaway obsessed with heavy metal and a beachfront living  pot smoking slacker who pretends he s a rock god meet and form a band  the birthmarks on both their butt cheeks form the group s moniker   opening with a funny prologue which apes a twisted sister video from the    s   the pick of destiny  is a fairly well produced movie aimed at older kids  it occasionally resembles nothing more than a middle aged variation of  wayne s world   with jokey stoner interludes and a climactic bout with beelzebub himself  yet black and gass have an enormously comfortable rapport  they also acted as producers  co wrote the script and all the music   the target audience will obviously go for it  though inspiration is a bit low  particularly in the second half  just about the time our heroes impulsively outrun the cops in a student driver car   the music sequences are far more successful than the attempts at movie satire and  for the first thirty minutes or so  jack black s manic enthusiasm is infectious       from,0,
this is one of the funniest shows on tv today  it hits the mark     of the time  usually after watching a sitcom after a few years  the actors become to cartoonish  as if they are trying to become the beloved characters they play  these actors have in my opinion stayed true to their roles  the chemistry is still there  the writing has not gone down and i still look forward to watching it  the family dynamic still seems real and the situations after all this time are not so far fetched to make it seem the writers are reaching into an empty bag trying to keep the show on for one more season it is one of the few shows i watch without the remote in my hand for quick switching,1,
this is a nice little lifetime movie about a guy  peter coyote  who s living the perfect suburban middle class life when late one night the police suddenly bust into his home and arrest him for the murder of some guy    years ago   in his prison cell coyote recounts to his wife the fateful events of    years ago and how he came into contact with wayne kennedy the man who he supposedly killed   from here the story is told in flashback fashion and the more you learn about wayne and coyote and how they came to meet and what happened when they did the more interested you get   the acting isn t anything to crow about  although the guy who plays wayne kennedy is pretty creepy enough  the real strong point of the movie is that mystery of what actually happened on the mountain  the wife spends the movie running around digging up clues to the mystery and each time something new comes up we are treated with another flashback revealing more of the mystery  it s actually pretty well   so as far as lifetime tv movie s go this little flick comes highly recommended   enjoy,1,
as a writer and a lapsed orthodox jewish woman  i was let down tremendously by this movie  the dialogue is hackneyed and wasteful  the characters  too engaged with lines ranging from the wrackingly prosaic to the stunningly melodramatic  aren t allowed to expand into genuinely textured individuals  the one trick musical score tries to make up for the blandness  swooping portentously into the silence to jar the viewer and the script out of protracted catatonia   like an adolescent revolutionary on a self righteous tirade  this film is blown away by the wisdom of its revelation  patriarchy is wrong  and thoroughly squanders its energies  hammering on this point  the resultant artistic crime is a complete lack of imaginative development  the moral crime is the reduction of human beings to caricatures  martyrs and grotesques,0,
this film is a fun little private eye detective story like they aren t made any more  it s all there  tom conway is the suave detective called the falcon  goldie locke  what s in a name  is his wisecracking bumbling sidekick  louisa braganza is the damsel in distress  and of course there are the damsels maid  the professor with the secret formula  the bad guy that wants the formula  and the police inspector who s after the falcon  there is a murder  and the falcon gets implicated  the scenery is night clubs  expensive hotel rooms  a luxury train  the suburbs  and beautiful cars  go watch this little gem when you see it pass by on afternoon tv,1,
ok  so it s a silly movie  but i think they knew that when they made it  and there are some neat little twists on the otherwise tired  overdone  godzilla  type genre  borrowed a tape just because i knew someone in it  but i did loan it out to a couple pals  who also kinda liked it,0,
of course this came out right at the beginning of the     s  of course it did  those drama students dancing in the street to irene cara s famous theme song  it s an indelible eighties leg warmer style image  but there s more to the film than that  there s deprivation  and one man s struggle to learn to read  and a struggle with sexuality  and an attack on a child  and one girl tricked into taking topless photographs  and contemplation of suicide  in the end  though  it is also about that song,1,
when i first saw this film it was about      and even though i saw it again recently i have not changed my mind about it  i think it was robert ryans best film  because he portrayed someone like my father  and he was a schizophrenic in real life  my father  although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse  having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt   my mother and brother had to do this when i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man  it was a very good imitation of this type of individual  and i was impressed,1,
like many others  i had been attracted to the combination of pollack  ford and scott thomas  i had enjoyed the work of pollack and ford on sabrina  a well made film and a careful rewrite of the old material  on hearing that this film was in production i ordered and read the book  immediately it seemed that this would be a more difficult story to film  the characters are not always sympathetic  there is little if any humor and the author makes numerous plot shortcuts to focus on his principal theme  that  since each would see the other as the only one sharing the unique combination of loss and betrayal brought on by the air crash  the adulterers  completely surprised spouses would seek each other out  moreover  he imagines that resolution could come to both through a bitter exploration of the adulterers  hidden lives and that this experience of  thick and thin  could yield a deeper love than each had previously  although much of the book deals with their bitterness and their building hatred of their former partners  in the end acceptance and forgiveness are found  the film script retains only the air crash and the shared predicament of the spouses  where the woman is the research aggressor in the book  it is the man in the film and the woman is never a willing co researcher  the film has a completely new dramatic sub plot for harrison ford which seems even more contrived than the double coincidence of the air crash  the  congresswoman up for re election  sub plot for the woman is also new  yet it works better  audience the expectations of pure romance or romantic comedy cannot be met because this story focusses on a very bitter pill  where resolution and forgiveness is achieved in the book  however  lifting the burden of bitterness from the reader and permitting levity  there is no corresponding moment in the film  although forgiveness is never hinted at  we are left to surmise that healing following a shooting does double duty  ford s character need not be such an unentertaining man of few words and scott thomas s accent change is a little disconcerting at first  this film is not the dead loss suggested by others  it is  however  a difficult film to appreciate because the rewrite and adaptation to the screen is below the standard previously achieved by the director cast,1,
this movie s basic premise is that everyone in the world can know that a person is gay except for that person  and that a man who likes show tunes  has good taste  and is neat in appearance must be a homosexual  yes  the movie is funny in parts  but the basic premise is to homophobic and insulting that the entire movie crumbles into something that is quite painful to sit through  the performances  particularly joan cusak and kevin kline are very good,0,
just read through the other comments here  and was a little surprised to find that no one had said anything about the acting or plot   richard pryor and eddie murphy can both deliver an amazing stand up comedy show  great actors they are not  enough about that   as for the plot  oh man  every time the movie tries to  fool  you into believing the good guys are going to lose  you know those scenes   what  the good guys loses  oh   i see  it was just a trick   it s done so terribly bad  you can spot it a mile away   it had   or   funny moments  but not enough to save the day   it s a little silly that these comments has to be    lines now  a lot of people will fill it up with crap  for it to be eligible  being brief is an art,0,
i consider myself a fan of jess franco and his trash movies  but nearly every time i see one of them  i just see missed opportunities and plots that don t play out well  this film is  unfortunately  no different  the film certainly had a lot of potential  as franco has fused the intriguing theme of the classic film  the most dangerous game  with his usual brand of trashy sleaze  but the plot here gets lost too often  and it takes an eternity for franco to get round to the main point of the movie  with this being a later franco film  you might be forgiven for thinking that the director would have got better  but actually i ve found that the opposite is true  as this and the terrible  killer barbys  are two of his very worst films  the plot focuses on a stripper and her sleazy boyfriend  the pair is invited to a private island by a rich woman and her lover  however  they soon find that they haven t been invited there for social reasons as they are  released  on the island so that the wealthy woman and her friends can hunt them down for sport    what attracted me to this film was the front cover and the fact that it was directed by the king of sleaze flicks  you d think  then  that i d be pleased that the movie features a plethora of sex scenes and general sleaze  but i m not  the reason for this is mostly that the sex and sleaze in the film is really boring and most of the time served only in giving me the condition known as  itchy fast forward finger   however  my inclination to see everything through to the end ensured that i had to lump it  there was a time when i didn t think girl on girl could possibly be boring  but i have since been proved wrong  the only positive i can pluck out the movie really is that the soundtrack is quite catchy  and despite it being silly foreign pop music  actually blends quite well with the sex scenes  i did enjoy the last ten minutes  as that s when the plot finally got going  but it was a case of too little too late and unfortunately  this is a severely lacklustre film  on the whole  i only recommend this film to those who feel they must see all      franco movies   everyone else should watch vampyros lesbos  faceless or she killed in ecstasy instead,0,
bridges s drama about a reporter who discovers some flaws in the safety precautions taken at a nuclear powerplant is directed well and a pretty interesting film from the late   s  its not amazing  but its solid  the acting is pretty good especially jack lemmon  but douglas and fonda were good too  it was a pretty good screenplay and bridges s direction was solid and suitable  this is definitely not one of the best films of the   s  but its one of the better ones  a good early michael douglas film and lemmon in his prime     imdb rating       my rating   so in simple words  solid but not amazing    thats what this film is  solid but not amazing,1,
anne  natalie portman  tells us about how much she hates her mother  adele  susane sarandon   that s how the movie begins  adele decided that her and her daughter were moving to california without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason  the story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter  it s really deep and touching  thanks to the great work of the actresses  natalie was nominated to a golden globe for that role  she is one of the most talented actresses i ever saw  and so is sarandon  they really look like mother daughter  the soundtrack is also great  the movie is incredible      out of,1,
recap  not entirely familiar with the shakespeare story of macbeth  but my wild guess is that this is pretty close to the original  only set in present time  it tells the story of macbeth  a member of a crime syndicate in melbourne      he is a valued hit man and in the favor of leader duncan  but he and his lady has higher ambitions than that  and plan the murder of duncan  and any competition of the throne  this is a story of betrayal and cold  brutal death   comments  very interesting idea  i must say  to use the story but change the setting to present time  but still keep the original     dialog  it sets a huge contrast between the classical poetic work and the violence  promised to be extremely violent  it is a promise that it keeps  but not in the notion i imagined  it is very bloody indeed  but the violence is slow  not just figuratively speaking that it is calculated  which it is too  but also literally  a lot of action is actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie to its knees   what could have been a unique strength  the contrast between the superfluous and poetic dialog and the extreme violence  now turns into something else entirely  now both slow the move down painfully much  so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at times   also i can t figure out the context the three witches act within  set to present time and reality i figure that such magical witchcraft had no place in the movie  apparently it does  but to me it seems completely out of place  not a subplot but a complete sub story with it s own rules  completely different than the rest of the movie  seems completely out of place  surely it must have been possible to convert that part too to something modern  drug induced hallucinations perhaps  which i suspect that the director hints at but then he has left way too much witchcraft in it to be believable   now they only bring stretches of the movie that is clearly beside the story and i just waited for the real movie to begin again   a clear disappointment  but maybe something for shakespearean buffs,0,
ninja iii is not quite as bad as  enter the ninja   the first part of this  trilogy   but it s still a very bad movie  it will hardly please the fans of martial arts movies  because there isn t enough action  but even the action scenes themselves are often spoiled by laughable excesses and needless violence  as if the film wasn t already weak enough  the filmmakers turn parts of it into an idiotic  the exorcist  rip off  the only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the  dominated  heroine  she is a beautiful and athletic woman  which the director doesn t forget to exploit in various sleazy ways   she just happens to be an aerobics teacher  i don t mind a little soft core exploitation  but it must not pretend to be something else,0,
while this film might not be the next evil dead   hell who knows maybe it will  it has only been out for a year  it is worth a look  don t expect a     million film  cuz you ll be disappointed  do expect to be entertain  to laugh  and to enjoy the experience all in all this film is much better than many if not all of the low budget horror films out there  i have seen films that spent more than    or    times what this film cost to make and turned out             times worse  the effort that was put into this film far out weighs the set backs it faces by having a limited budget  movies are meant to entertain  and this movie sure does that  in fact this film might even open up new doors for you in movie watching  it s available on netflix if not your local video rental store  so watch it  then decide,1,
well  killshot is not awful  but it comes close  production values are decent and the main actors do a pretty good job  except for rosario dawson in a wasted role   but the story is just pathetic  i don t know if the elmore leonard book had such dumb characters since i haven t read it  but i m guessing that the book was supposed to be at least slightly humorous  the movie has no detectable humor  after the first twenty minutes  you ll be yelling at the screen   oh  come on  nobody s that stupid    in a nutshell  and without any spoilers  everybody acts in a manner convenient to the plot  which makes no sense anyway  a very frustrating and unrealistic movie  which may account for it sitting on the shelf for as long as it did,0,
steven segal has done some awful films  but this is probably one of the best since his career took a dive about ten years ago  the cast is better than usual  and while the story and the plot are a total joke  at least most of the action scenes look pretty good   the plot is probably one of the worst in film history  someone is being executed because he stole some money  some mercenary types kidnap a supreme court justice  their goal is to exchange the judge for the prisoner so they can find out where he has the money  meanwhile the execution chamber is full of trap doors and false floors and looks like a set from one of the cirque du soleil circus shows   then there is the issue of the prison  here  the warden is a homie  played by tony plana  the prisoners all have their gang colors and signs  and the guards are there to serve the meals and keep the prison clean  nothing like a bunch of prisoners fighting and beating up some guards while the warden is watching  what happens  the warden gives them a stern talking to  he might punish them next time   there are a lot of moments in this movie that are good for laughs  however  nia peeples looks pretty good  and ja rule tries to be an action hero  lots of fun watching the prisoners all  do the right thing  and get armed so that they can free the supreme court justice from her captors  regardless of how bad half past dead may be  when you watch it keep in mind that it is easily the best movie that steven segal has starred in since under siege in,0,
eagle s wing is a pleasant surprise of a movie    keeps the viewer interested  i didn t know anything about it being made by the british until i read the other viewer comments  i can understand why it won an award for cinematography  for it was brilliantly presented   must have looked magnificent on a vast theatre screen   it seemed to be a lot more realistic than most westerns  in portraying how the west was more truly won  as well as the complexities of the characters it presents  the indian sam waterson character is particularly intriguing  he seems to be brutal in the savage environment he is conditioned to  but displays remarkable respect for the frailties he witnesses in the white men   women he encounters  he is not friendly or sensitive to these intruders in his lands  but he has a limit to his sense of vengeance  even a compassion when he is in a position of power   observing the wilting white man bent on revenge  as well as the girl he kidnaps after capturing a stagecoach  as such  his character seems complex but congruous to the harsh lands he lived in   which were threatened by these intruders he is not heartless in his dealings with   the magnificent horse he rides is a critical link   it is interesting to note how this indian handles it  compared with the martin sheen character who has it in his possession   power for a time   eagle s wing  is an unusual western  a genre i am not drawn to  but i really appreciated this excellent offering  which i would rate second only to  a man called horse,1,
you ve got to think along the lines of last tango in paris for this one because the mood and emotion runs along the same lines and maintains the same heights   the difference being that in this exceptional  intense and torrid depiction of love among the ruins of a dostoyevskyian dispossessed the setting is a gay subcultural milieu   perhaps even one that is set to vanish in time  and not the equally arresting but heterosexual context of bertolucci s own film   the last third of this film depicts a passionate love never seen in gay cinema  to talk of pornography or gay self effacement misses the point and intelligence of this work  this film  though on first impression appears to take us into the familiar   often depicted underworld of gay street life  then precedes to subvert the rules of this genre by exaggerating it to a super real degree  the result is a hyper charged emotional heightening   an exceptional strategy that elevates the drama to one of big universal themes and giant gestures   this film snatches the high ground because of the brilliant performances by it s actors  notably a young jean hugues anglade and the directing  a tour  de  force of cinema  outstanding in ambition and it s unceasing plummet into the depths of human emotion  as a contribution to gay cinema  this film conquers this difficult ground and makes it it s own triumph,1,
it is by far the most definitive film on the police force which i have seen  although not directed by ram gopal varma  it has all the elements of an rgv film  dead straight dialogues  blunt treatment of the subject  brilliant direction  and superb performances  even by those with little job to do in the movie   the chemistry between nana and the don  even if they are professional rivals  is amazing  and so are the small events like an insider not giving information to imtiaz even while he is being bashed up in the locker  but only to nana when he is out  the change in working conditions with the change of the senior is dealt wonderfully  the first half keeps one absolutely engrossed  moving like a documentary with nana acting like a mentor to jatin explaining to him the intricacies and philosophy of the work   overall one of the most brilliant films on cops in indian cinema  definitely not to be missed,1,
excellent hitchcock thriller with robert cummings proving once again that he could really act up a storm   this time he is a defense plant worker caught up in a horrible plot when his best friend is killed at the plant   priscilla lane is the girl who suddenly becomes interested in cummings as the plot thickens and he is pursued from california to n y   there is a diabolical plot by a group of wealthy  th columnists to destroy from from within  hitchcock was known to play up the upper echelons of society involved in mayhem in his long career as a director   ironically  the film implodes at the very end  while we see what happens to the guy who killed cummings  friend  we don t see what happens to the rest of the gang  again  many of whom represent the upper crust of society,1,
a     foot long  giant mutant squid with five tentacles  razor fangs and the ability to reproduce it s own cells terrorizes a small florida town  various marine biologists  doctors and cops plot to kill it  meanwhile  a human monster named miller offs people who discover the  devilfish  is a manmade creation used for the greedy benefit of some evil doctors  miller attacks a female researcher  strangles her  drowns her in the bathtub  tosses in a hairdryer  then rips the panties off her dead body   lots of false alarms are set when our heroes peter  stella  janet and bob set out on a high tech  high tech for       anyway   seaquarium  boat to catch the creature  who is frequently seen in close up or hilariously obvious speeded up film to seem more menacing  and only fire can destroy it  which leads to a flamethrower armed posse vs  aquatic beast finale   this jaws cash in is pretty tame  other than a legless corpse and a decapitation  but watchable and benefits from an excellent antony barrymore score and a decent  again  for       monster design  luigi cozzi and sergio martino wrote the original story   score    out of,0,
i first saw this when i was a teen in my last year of junior high  i was riveted to it  i loved the special effects  the fantastic places and the trial aspect and flashback method of telling the story   several years later i read the book and while it was interesting and i could definitely see what swift was trying to say  i think that while it s not as perfect as the book for social commentary  as a story the movie is better  it makes more sense to have it be one long adventure than having gulliver return after each voyage and making a profit by selling the tiny lilliput sheep or whatever   it s much more arresting when everyone thinks he s crazy and the sheep do make a cameo anyway  as a side note  when i saw laputa i was stunned  it looks very much like the kingdom of zeal from the chrono trigger video game        that also made me like this mini series even more   i saw it again about   years ago  and realized that i still enjoyed it just as much  really high quality stuff and began an excellent run of sweeps mini series for nbc who followed it up with the solid merlin and interesting alice in wonderland,1,
about one step above an olsen s twins film  there s a nary a surprise in store here except for how repulsive the bloated  hunchbacked depardieu looks walking around the beach without a shirt on  this guy was supposed to be some sort of heartthrob  quasimodo hubba hubba  well  whatever   katherine heigl s a great actress  whose career over the last several years has displayed a lot of her potential as both a comedic and dramatic actress  but this movie definitely didn t do anything to offer her a break out role  her vapid character lacks any trace of personality or self esteem  spending her entire vacation crushing on a cute boy that she thinks is the greatest guy in then world  basically because he s a cute boy   yet she can t be honest with him for two seconds  ladies  let me tell you something  if a guy s really into you  he s not going to stomp off in a huff because you tried to pass your dad off as your boyfriend  he may be a little confused about why you d do something so silly  contrived  and um   incestuous  but in the end it s just going to be something you ll laugh together about   the plot and dialogue hits every clche  right on cue  no originality and no wit   but it s rilly  rilly sweet and ben s rilly  rilly cute so viewers who think titanic is the greatest movie ever made will of course say this movie is great because they won t notice that it doesn t have a brain in its head  one star,0,
at last  a great film that doesn t have to be edited for profanity or sex  it s a fun film that the whole family can enjoy  willis is great  as always   rusty  was delightful  just enough action to keep interest going,1,
terrible  there s no way to get around it  a script at the level of one from some mexican soap opera  a choice and use of the places of shooting that make the movie labyrinthine and at the same time  repetitive and monotonous  with disastrous performances of almost the entire cast  the references to tarantino s work  so poorly made  are more an insult than anything else  i suspect that was not for the shameless and plot unrelated exploitation of matadinho s generous curves   nobody would take the effort to go watch this film to any theater   these are the kind of films that make me have no desire to watch portuguese cinema,0,
this was a really interesting halloween film  i wasnt to thrilled with the whole thorn theory but it still makes for a good film  i liked getting to see tommy doyle back but sadly donald pleasance died right after shooting  the film had a really really bad director who didnt give a flip about the series  from what i heard treated donald bad  and wouldnt let danielle harris come back as jamie  its like he was just trying to bring down the film  but i still liked it  there were alot of cuts and music changes and if you re lucky you can get the producers cut which features over    min  of never before scenes  with those scenes it turns into a whole new movie  check it out if you have the chance,1,
i m a fan of good  plausible  action movies  and i m a huge fan of the elite military units such as the navy seals  finally  i m a huge fan of michael biehn  sadly none of those allowed me to really enjoy this movie at the time  i gave it another chance more recently when i bought the dvd  here s the problems with this movie in a quick list     it s a poor mans top gun  for example including a virtual music video of the seal team playing golf with a soundtrack of  the boys are back in town   which concludes with charlie sheen doing an inane chase to get his towed car back      this is quite simply a charlie sheen movie  when sheen was trying to be famous before he started doing stuff like hot shots  reports i ve heard indicate that sheen was a baby on the set and it affected the roles and direction the rest of the actors in the movie got      biehn is the head of the seal team yet sheen seldom obeys him  any seal showing the lack of discipline that sheen s character does  or who endangered the team as he does  wouldn t even have made it through buds training let alone gotten on a team      seals are cross trained on weapons  yet in one part of the movie a seal has to  figure out  how to use a u s  stinger missile   there are a few good scenes in the movie  the assault entry at the beginning  bill paxton as  god   and some of the footage in what was supposed to be beirut at the time  overall though this movie is a loser,0,
i channel surfed past this many times  mainly because the synopsis sounded so cheesy  so  love american style   however  it turned out to be quite good  very well done  the two stand out features are the dialog and acting  great cast  the premise is actually well executed and there aren t too many weak moments  i guess what i was most amazed by was how often you thought the wheels are going to come off the cart  and instead  the cart just banks the turns  so to speak  and the movie keeps flying  there are some nice little sub plots  particularly the relationship that develops between the character played by former conan sidekick andy richter  also  want to mention that the music accompanying it was good,1,
yeah it may not be for adults  and some adults may find it stupid  but if you don t think about it it s really not that bad   the story has alvin and his gang  going across the world  in search of jewels for a bad person  and the misadventures that they come in contact with   so the animation is good  and the story is cute  and the songs are forgettable but it s a good movie   i give it a   out of    or     out of   stars,0,
i m sitting around going through movie listings and not really seeing anything i want to see  my appetite keeps saying   something like broadcast news   that s what i want  something smart and funny  with adult ideas and great acting and writing  and a directorial style that doesn t call attention to itself  this may well be hurt s best performance  is this or the big chill  to my mind   however eccentric  hurt is smart  and to play an unintelligent person without making sure    wink wink    the audience knows    wink wink    hey  i m not stupid    well  that s fine acting right there  hunter is note perfect  and albert brooks is a revelation   and he can read and sing at the same time   great  great work,1,
i would say this is a background movie  play it the background as your tending to busy work  laundry  checking email  etc   i thought this was a film that was done before amy adams became successful after enchanted  wrong  it was done in       the screenplay script is pretty awful  i love musicals but the singing is just average and doesn t move the plot along  ughh  it almost seems like it s a made for tv movie based on the cinematography  am i watching a tv show    even the secretary breaks out into song  what the f    is going on   actually she seemed to have the best voice  amy adams was so great in enchanted  lead actor is average  disappointed for sure  this movie would have been good for lifetime  but that s about it,0,
i know the girl who did the figure skating for the lead girl  she once dated my brother and she was always really nice  i also live in cranbrook b c  about    or so minutes from fort steele  haha i used to go there for field trips when i was in elementary school  it was kinda weird seeing it in the movie  i also had the chance when the movie was filming to be an extra because there was a casting call for them at the mall but i didn t feel like going to it at the time because i wasn t interested in acting  now i totally wish i did  this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  it never came out here   which is kind of weird seeing it was partially filmed here  so i was excited when it came  i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute but if anyone has a question about fort steele  just ask away,1,
from the golden period of british films  this has my vote for one of the funniest of all time  screened yesterday at my film society to a rapturous audience  i was astonished at how well the comedy has lasted  made in         it is really down to the expert timing and inimitable playing from two of the finest actors britain has produced  margaret rutherford and alastair sim  adapted from a play by john dighton  this farce is briskly handled by director frank launder  the plot is simple  a ministry mistake billets a girls  school on a boys  school  i will always laugh when i think of this film,1,
sleeper cell attempts to swim both sides of the pool  terrorism patriotic muslim americans   and it does neither very well   i had put off watching this show for a very long time  because i had a feeling it would be too predictable  but after a year in my netflix queue  i finally moved it up to the front   the show is about an undercover muslim man working for the fbi in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the united states  the undercover agent in the show actually is a muslim  so we see his conflict resolution between his patriotism and his religious beliefs  personally i would have rather watched a drama about a muslin american family living in the united states  but it is doubtful that an america tv channel  cable or network  will ever produce anything that shows muslims in a flattering light   i am not a muslim  but i have a lot of muslim american friends  and i can honestly say that none of them are terrorists and they all love america   sleeper cell comes close to busting stereotypes of muslims  but it also focuses on the worse muslim stereotypes  in the first episode we see an  honor killing   which is a very poor portrayal of islam  but in the  rd episode we see a very respected moderate muslim scholar teaching the viewer that the real jihad is actually a personal struggle that is not meant to incite violence towards others   if only the moderate muslim scholar had been the main character of the show   americans need to learn a lot more about islam  sleeper cell helps a little bit  but it comes up far short of giving the america audience what it really needs to knows   that said  the acting in this show is superb  and the drama is extremely engrossing  if only they had made this show about islam in america without the terrorism  it would have been first rate,1,
unless you re interested in seeing   hours worth of scenic mountain footage featuring hysterical characters  lots of histrionics and cheap   s gore  not much of it either   i would advise to avoid this movie  it is long winded  overlong and has a rather annoying amateurish feel to it  masterpiece  no  an average thriller  shot in an average fashion  in a gorgeous italian landscape    i m a huge fan of slow paced      movies  when there is a plot to delight and entertain you  in this case  it didn t work out for me  the plot is trite  interlaced with superficial and stereotypical characters  backed by hilarious angry mobs and your typical italian widow dressed all in black  sobbing   if you are not acquainted and familiar with the italy country side  the movie might be worth seeing as the scenery itself is spectacular and rather breathtaking  this movie isn t however  nothing out of the ordinary  there are much better italian horror flicks than this  not much else than a yawn fest,0,
i absolutely love this film  everything about it  it almost felt like watching me and my friends on screen  the way this movie was filmed was a pure masterpiece  very original and creative  i related to these characters and even had the same thoughts as some  i m really glad i ran across this movie  if only there were more genius  like justin out there,1,
back in the cold and creepy early    s a show called  family matters  aired and became an instant classic the trick was to buy a manual in standard family situations and their solutions and insert some attempts to sarcastic remarks in it and you had yourself a lovely little stealing is wrong parents are right show  so that worked out fine  so bickley warren had a new ambitious plan  making the exact same show again   here s the difference though   family matters  had urkel   step by step  has the guy from those  kickboxer  sequels nobody saw  he says things like  dudette  and  the dane meister   and somehow the audience is still not supposed to hate him  i mean seriously   dudette   how can you even get that across your lips   the rest of the people were mostly white versions of the whole winslow bunch  combined with some more one or zero dimensional characters  like the dumb guy  jt  well  eddie   the smart girl  laura   and a pretty girl who spends her days looking pretty in theory  the character development was just awful in this show  grover and the cookie monster have more depth than the lambert family  everybody just milked their stereotypes for what they were worth  they weren t worth much   powered by a massive laugh and cheer tape stolen from something funny this show aired for a whopping   years which was humiliating for the competition although you ll have to note that this is the time where family sitcoms were pretty much all big hits everybody just ignored their crappyness because well it was the   s one more crappy show didn t hurt,0,
in      tangier  a wealthy american woman and her two children are kidnapped by berbers  murderous desert pirates who scorn the moroccan government and  by doing so  kidnap  american pestilence   which attracts the attention of u s  president theodore roosevelt  fictitious historical epic is less a grand adventure than it is a peculiar  somewhat exhaustive throwback to the desert sheik films of the     s  with a bit of  the king and i  interjected  besides   portraying the cloaked  mustachioed  bloodthirsty leader and his snippy  haughty captive  sean connery and candice bergen could be acting in two entirely different movies  neither one seems to know how far to carry the camp elements of their characters and dialogue  and both seem singularly without proper direction   the various  and anonymous  slashings and beheadings which occur are arbitrary  we don t know any of these victims  and the big action scenes become blurry  noisy montages of sand swept violence on horseback  the pluses  a much lauded music score by jerry goldsmith  oscar nominated  but a loser to john williams   jaws    fine location shooting and cinematography       from,0,
if you love japanese monster movies  you ll love this action packed battle pitting an alien invader  intent upon conquering the earth  and a  giant robot  with an armory of super weaponry  the alien   emporer guillotine   from the planet gargoyle  has a army of thugs called   of course   the gargoyle gang   as well as an endless supply of immense hostile creatures that are routinely loosed upon the earth to smash buildings  make loud noises  panic the populace  etc  a little kid  named johnny sokko  has the giant robot at his beckon call  and sends the robot  as needed  to beat up  and then blast these creatures  johnny joins a group of  good spies  called unicorn  and endeavors to help save the world   in spite of the campy nature  unintentionally humorous dialog  and the fact that the target audience was obviously children  this movie has non stop action  colorful characters  decent special effects  and just happens to be downright fun to watch  battle scenes are well executed  and frequent  as the storyline requires  the good guys and bad guys both made sure they had an inexhaustible supply of bombs  lasers  ammunition  and schemes to attack each other  in spite of the fact the movie was constructed from edited episodes of a tv series  the plot actually develops  and reaches an ultimate conclusion   the film has a positive outlook and appeals to everyone s  especially kids   desire to destroy evil in its many forms  kids may be the target audience  but it s fun for everyone to laugh at its comical silliness  yet  at the same time  root for the good guys to prevail and  save the world   the acting is cheesy in places  but that is the charm  there are several lines of corny dialog  possibly translation errors or possibly intentional jokes by the movie makers   and you ll find yourself quoting these absurd lines later   admittedly  this film is not high in production quality or budget  however  for what it is  campy sci fi  it s enjoyable for some laughs  i recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor for that sort of thing,1,
rowan atkinson s creation mr bean has stood the test of time and will be forever etched upon the memory of those who viewed it   living alone and appearing not to have a job of any description mr bean goes around doing day to day activities in a rather comedic fashion the mistake prone mr bean induces heartfelt laughter when put even in the most simplest situations though he barely spoke any coherent words his jovial actions more than made up for this   even when driving in his beloved mini mr bean still manages to cause inadvertent chaos not very much is known about his background but his ability to draw tears of laughter from the audience at his funny shenanigans is well known   before he found fame nick hancock can be seen in a couple of the episodes,1,
i have had more boring stretches of    minutes in my life  but none are coming to mind right now  hell ride is based on the retro cult   s theme that tarantino brought back  and did right  in movies like pulp fiction and reservoir dogs  the problem with hell ride is  unlike pf and rd  the story is garbage and so is character development  how many movies does bishop think he can blatantly steal from  the brief case in pulp fiction  the air gun in no country  etc  etc  speaking of bishop what the hell is he doing acting in this movie  i couldn t help but laugh at those scenes where he s standing with his pelvis trusted out  desperately trying to seem like some hardened biker  nothing in this movie is believable  and why dennis hopper  did they really need the easy rider motif too  i blame larry bishop  for his horrible plot and dialogue  not to mention his failed attempt at the leading role  don t bother watching this movie  it s a waste of time,0,
no one said that in  the big trail  and i thought it would be a natural  nevertheless  this was one of the best westerns i have seen and i am a big fan of horses and gunsmoke movies  the scope and feel of this picture is simply staggering and  as someone mentioned in their comment  it does have the feel of the   camera triptych of  napoleon          nowadays the cost of the production and  especially  the cast of thousands  would be prohibitive  but raoul walsh got it done   the cast was excellent  although john wayne was better when he had no lines and just swaggered around  in particular  tyrone power sr  was a perfect villain   i had never seen him before and this was his only talking picture  ian keith was a snake  but el brendel is an acquired taste as the comic relief  he can be funny or annoying  but mostly the latter   and he shows up at the most inappropriate times   it is a bit too long and it took a while for the indians to show up  but this is as close to a documentary on manifest destiny and as true to life as you will see and a must for movie fans regardless of genre preference  by the time the settlers got to california i was exhausted,1,
i love ghost stories and i will sit through a movie til it s end  even if i m not really enjoying it  i rarely feel like i wasted my time    but  this adaptation of the bell witch story was horrible    it wasn t scary in the least bit  what is with the comic relief moments  the dialog was tedious  acting inconsistent the movie was way too long and some scenes were unnecessarily drawn out in my open   like the birthday party   the only good think i can think about mentioning is the costumes and props were well done   i am curious about other adaptation  but until then  i will stick to reading about the story,0,
i loved the original  i watch it every year  but the second is a piece of garbage and it never should have been made  the second could have worked if there was a different location  the son was not an original or didn t even act like one of eddie s kids  third was too smart for eddie which downplayed his father role  none of the other kids where in it  it just could of been a lot better  i don t know why they even tried to make this movie  there was no continuncy from the first movie  i will pretend that this one doesn t even exist  it is sad that the actors didn t even see that they where made fools of  a really bad movie  i just think that i wasted an hour or more on a bad movie and i really love all of the national lampoon films,0,
well  dude where s my car might be at least a novelty as one of few hollywood films that seems to have been written  cast  filmed   edited in less than a day  i honestly can t believe this got made  or that i allowed my friends to make me sit through the entire thing   the jokes are too stupid and predictable to be  dumb funny   and the actors involved don t seem like they would be capable of pulling off any kind of funny had the script actually provided it  oddly enough  unlike most mindless slapstick comedies  this movie actually has too much plot   every scene seems to introduce a new moronic and uninteresting subplot  of course  they were obviously going for moronic  but it doesn t work on any level whatsoever   there is only one aspect of this film i enjoyed  donkeylips from the old nickalodean show  salute your shorts  has a very small role  this is the role that will turn him into the next richard gere though  you just watch,0,
i love the thackeray novel on which this film is based  and while this modern version of becky sharp s story is a b film  the casting of loy  in her first top billed role  is rather fascinating   before loy became mgm s reigning good girl in scores of genteel and comic roles  she was an actress  vanity fair was loy s follow up film to emma  in which she played a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroys the loyal housekeeper  marie dressler    loy s becky is much nastier than miriam hopkins  version   years later in becky sharp  loy s becky is very much a pre code film character with her plunging necklines and amoral ways  it s the type of character that jean harlow or clara bow could easily have played  but becky here is still supposed to be of the genteel set  that s what makes her fallen character so tragic   in counterpoint to loy s grasping becky is the goody goody amelia  barbara kent  who is just not an interesting character  mary forbes is icily good as mrs  sedley  most of the other actors in this version are pretty blah  conway tearle as rawdon  walter byron as osborne  anthony bushell as dobbin  others are nearly dickensian is their quirkiness  billy bevan as joseph  lionel belmore as crawley  montagu love as the marquis  lilyan irene as polly the maid  elspeth dudgeon as the housekeeper   loy is front and center throughout  while the ending is rather shocking  she has several excellent scenes  such as the gambling scene in the casino where she tries to steal another woman s winning roulette bet  the more loy s becky descends morally  the more beautiful she gets until she is finally  caught   bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by loy in a film that should be seen,1,
i saw this movie on it s opening night  and enjoyed it  i probably would have enjoyed it more if i hadn t been sitting by my father  my father saw the original  unfortunately  i have not seen it yet  and kept talking through the whole thing  he kept saying that the movie sucked  and that it was stupid  the thing is  he didn t understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film  in every horror movie  there is always a certain character depicted  if they weren t in the movie  well  you might not really like it too much  the trademark characters are    the lead character   carly  elisha cuthbert   the lead character s boyfriend   wade  jared padalecki   the lead character s sibling  soon to be reformed jerk   nick  chad michael murray   the annoying sluttish character   paige  paris hilton   characters who are just around to look pretty   dalton  jon abrahams    blake  robert ri chard   with those characters  it makes it slightly predictable who will die and who will live  obviously  you know who will with what i just typed  the movie may be predictable  in fact  i had a pretty good idea who would die just by watching the trailer   but it was still enjoyable  it may seem stupid  why is there a sugar mill in the middle of a deserted camp site that wasn t there in the beginning   at times  but it is very easy to watch  the comedy and gore were the perfect amount for weak stomached movie goers it does get gory  don t get me wrong   less than  final destination    but it works very well  so in conclusion  this movie wasn t as hot as the fire the set went up in  but the temperature could still burn the  wax,1,
i watched this movie on video the other night and found myself dozing off throughout this uninspired snoozefest  first of all  one of my biggest pet peeves is when movies like this are characterized as horror movies  it is a thriller  get it right it has no monsters or anything supernatural  it is simply a movie about a twisted serial killer  actually there is a very small body count so it is more of a serial torturer movie and it did a good job of torturing me   the basic premise of a man luring teenagers to his house of horrors through online chat rooms could have made for a great movie but we only see him lure one pair of teen girls through the internet at the very beginning of the film  one of these girls turns out to be a local detective s daughter and he gets emotionally involved in the case  the film quickly changes from a potentially intelligent sado masochistic thriller to a boring old cat and mouse game between the incredibly dull detective and the psychopathic captain howdy carleton hendricks played adequately by writer producer twisted sister frontman  dee snider  the occasional attempts at meaningful poetic one liners about the positive effects of pain and the like from snider are laughable  if he is attempting to get people to subscribe to these opinions through this film  he fails miserably and  unintentionally  makes light of them  the directing by john pieplow  whose only previous directing effort was jurassic women  which i will let the title speak for itself  was uninspired and there was something wrong with the editing which resulted in the film being disjointed with a few scenes completely unrelated to the plot  unless the screenplay is at fault  which is quite possible   this film a completely unsuccessful attempt at a thriller trying to pass of as a horror movie that s only achievement was making me squirm at the sight of a few graphic bodily piercings  if you see it at your video store don t waste your money but if you need something to laugh at one night and strangeland is on cable  you might as well watch    out of,0,
i am a huge tenacious d fan  and i think this is not the funniest movie in the world  but the most entertaining  it s not laugh a minute but that s not what the d intended it to be  i went into the movie seeing all the hbo shows  memorized both albums  and that made it even more enjoyable  plenty of inside jokes from past tenacious d albums  and hbo shows  since i knew the new album already  i knew    minutes of the movie because it is a musical comedy  i would say it has the best first   minutes of any movie and the best last   minutes of any movie  hands down   see this movie now,1,
with what they had  john and carolyn were very private so the writers had to put together what they could  i really liked portia de rossi as carolyn  but jacqueline bisset s voice grated on my nerves  she should have used her regular voice  i would have preferred that the whole movie focus on john and carolyn instead of rehashing stuff we already know about john,1,
i ve only seen this film once when it was shown on tv but i can still remember it    years later so that must say something about it  i thought it was an intelligent look into schooling  friendship  bullying and the influence it can have leading into adult life   the title really refers to how being good or bad at sports can either make you the lowest of the low or you will be tolerated by the cliques within school and even later on into adulthood if you re good at it  this is set in a private school in england but it could be anywhere   the main character is bad at games  seeks revenge in later life which all culminates in a climactic confrontation on a cricket pitch  i must admit i was gutted by the ending   it was powerful and saddening,1,
loved today s show    it was a variety and not solely cooking  which would have been great too   very stimulating and captivating  always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next  she is as down to earth and as personable as you get  like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable  special guests  who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too  loved the  first  theme and that the audience was invited to play along too  i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things  but she did it and by golly i ll be writing those recipes down  saving time in the kitchen means more time with family  those who haven t tuned in yet  find out what channel and the time  i assure you that you won t be disappointed,1,
being a d b  sweeney fan  i ve been on the lookout for this movie for quite some time  i recently rented the video and found it very enjoyable  it had some really hilarious scenes  the dysfunctional lives of some of the characters was unsettling  but i think the movie also showed that it s possible to keep your life on track or get it back on track if it s been derailed,1,
a warning to potential viewers of this experimental film  the nature of the imagery and the effects are such that this is one of those types of films that should really be seen on film  projected  the pixellation created by digital transfers sucks a lot of depth and adds a lot of noise to already abstract and grainy film  however  since this movie is pretty much unavailable in any format  i suppose you ll have to make do with what you can   anyway  this most excellent artistic endeavor comes courtesy of the guy who would eventually give us shadow of the vampire  it s a dark and dirty film of the genesis of the elements  as far as i can glean from the character names  through a process horrifying and surreal  begotten is a very good example of what is known as abject art  a stylistic approach that seeks meaning through the visceral more than the thematic   and visceral describes it  not very much stuff happens in the movie technically  but the levels of emotion it ll put you through are innumerable  the very repetitiveness of some of the imagery creates a mesmerizing catch over the senses  the sound editing and score in particular are immaculate  and serve the imagery incredibly well   fans of this film would do well to check out the collections of short films released through other cinema dvd  experiments in terror i  ii  and iii  movies such as these make me more and more certain that the realm of true horror resides in the abstract  abject  and non narrative  rather than in spooky tales of ghosts and axe murderers     polarisdib,1,
how pointless  hideous characters and boring film  saved by brief sex scenes  mad witch  gorgeous desert island and brooks body  the plot is tenuous  the characters are shallow and unlikeable  having said that i did manage to watch it all  mainly because i was totally transfixed by the jiggling and kind of hoping that her character would come good in the end  the film was well shot  well directed but perhaps the casting let it down in some ways  disappointing  really summed the review up in the first line but this website dictates that you need to write    lines minimum  it would be better to spend the time watching another film,0,
i rented this movie from a local library without having any prior knowledge of the book it is based on or the movie itself  purely based on the chance that it s one of those rare  overlooked gems that one can discover from time to time and really enjoy   unfortunately this is not one of those movies  i am not sure if this is a movie driven by sentimentality or worse  deliberate agenda  but certain elements of it made it impossible to immerse  it is supposed to portray a struggling immigrant worker community which tries to cope with the difficult realities of their life  that is a fine premise and it could have made for a gripping story  but the execution just made me alternate between getting annoyed and amused at the ridiculousness of it   here we have a community of simple farm workers who migrated to the us in search of employment and who get used and abused repeatedly by evil white men  and when i say evil   i mean evil  all white people in this movie are sinful  racist  sadistic  abusive devils whose sole purpose in life is sexual depravity intertwined with exploiting the poor immigrants  it would be a sad story if it wasn t so unintentionally grotesque and therefore hilarious   the portrayal of the immigrants is also a poster worthy example of exaggeration except that it goes in the opposite direction  the immigrants are saintly  clean and could serve as ointment for boo boos and ouies the world over  i couldn t help but laugh when i saw these  field workers  presumably digging in the ditches all day with their notoriously clean clothes and chiseled hair cuts from a top notch hair salon  a little restraint and a more unbiased hand at the helm could have made this a much better movie evoking some intended emotion rather than sarcastic snickers,0,
years before pre nuptial agreements became a regular thing  ernest lubitsch made a screen comedy on which they are the basis  bluebeard s eighth wife involves gary cooper as a multi millionaire living on the french riviera who s been married seven times and now marries claudette colbert for number eight  but cooper s a good sport about it  he always settles with his ex wives for a            a year as per an agreement they sign before marrying him  sounds like what we now call a pre nuptial agreement   of course claudette wants a lot more than that and she feels cooper takes an entirely too business like approach to marriage  she d like the real deal and is willing to go some considerable lengths to get it   bluebeard s eighth wife has some really funny moments  the original meeting of cooper and colbert in a men s store where cooper is insisting he wants only pajama tops and colbert looking for only bottoms  and of course my favorite is colbert trailing and blackmailing the detective cooper sends to spy on her  herman bing has the best supporting role in the film as that selfsame  flustered detective   i ve often wondered how back in the day hollywood could get away with casting so many people who are non french in a film like this  of course cooper is an american and colbert of the cast is the only one actually of french background  though david niven is charming as always  having him be a frenchman is ludicrous  he is sooooooo british   nevertheless bluebeard s eighth wife is an enjoyable film and a great example of what was called  the lubitsch touch  back in the day,1,
imagine you have just been on a plane for    hours  you have been on a business trip to south africa  you are a high paid professional  you ve lived in the us for    years  you are in your thirties  you have a wife a little boy and another baby on the way  one thing  even though you have a green card  you are still egyptian  on transit you are asked to come with   security guards  next thing you know you are overpowered  hooded and chained and after a brief   but still reasonably civil  interrogation you are to be rendered  this is what happens to anwar el ibrahimi at the beginning of the movie  his is a story of pain and   literally  torture  it s one of several story lines  one follows his wife s attempts to get more information  one follows the  cold  bureaucrats behind the rendition  another story deals with the family of the man who leads the interrogation of anwar el ibrahimi  there are some other stories too and by the end they all neatly come together  though the more famous actors like reese witherspoon   as the distraught pregnant wife   jake gyllenhaal   as the cia rookie forced to watch the interrogation in northern africa  and meryl streep   as cia hotshot corine whitman  it is really the more unknown actors that carry the story and give it it s heart  for me the actor playing the unfortunate mr el ibrahimi   omar metwally   was the heart and soul of this movie  his portrayal of a man in distress was shockingly well done  it s almost as if he was being tortured for real  also israeli actor yigal naor was very impressive as the part worried family man and part extremely cruel chief of torture  hard to watch and not exactly fun  but still very worthwhile,1,
what can i say  an excellent end to an excellent series  it never quite got the exposure it deserved in asia  but by far  the best cop show with the best writing and the best cast on televison  ever  the end of a great era  sorry to see you go,1,

seems like some of the previous reviewers has seen another movie than what i saw earlier tonight    actually  this movie is the reason why i registered at imdb  sure bobbie phillips can  fight  and for that i give this movie a    but the rest of this movie is just pure crap    the acting is bad  the plot is bad  the camera angles are bad  and the effects are bad  sure the actors are in physical good shape  but they cannot act  sometimes i enjoy watching bad movies for the laugh  but this movie had no charm and after i saw this movie i was filled with regrets for seeing it  sure  if you would like to see mediocre fighting without anything else then this movie is for you  if not then stay away from this film  ps  sorry for any spelling mistakes    i am just tired as a cause of this movie,0,
bhagam bhag was a waste of money and time big time  i wonder y govinda did this movie  govinda   dude   m your big fan  u have to make right decisions now in choosing movie  i wonder he had any role in that movie govinda s role could be given to johnny lever  akshay kumar steals the show here  akshay   dud u rock  u have created space in everybody s heart all over the world  lara dutta  tansuhree     u guys deserve better  paresh rawal is good at his witty  overall there were few scene where i laughed   otherwise i was just wondering  y the hell did priyadarshan made such a stupid movie   anyways  lets wait and watch upcoming movie,0,
mr  bean is just a bunch of unfunny slapstick humour  it is the most shallow humour tv series ever made in history  the scenes are often disgusting and the horrible canned laughter sends chills through the spine  mr  bean is a selfish and rude character and one can only sympathies how pathetic he is  it is incredible that such a tv series of low quality can be sustained for   years  it is a complete waste of time to watch even   episode and one can t help but to express disgust and pity why rowen had portrayed himself as such a   dimensional  unfunny and ridiculous character  or pity yourself why you had even bother to watch an episode  watching this is an aggravating experience,0,
the sort of  little  film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore  sort of a  soul  version of the more well known  the last of the blonde bombshells   ian mcshane is excellent as a dj and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re uniting the members of a classic soul group  and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members  a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as isaac hayes  as well as acting stalwarts taurean blacque  derrick o connor and antonio fargas  not meant to be an epic by any means  this is nonetheless a chunk of solid gold,1,
why would this film be so good  but only gross an estimated             and have no award nominations  john travolta knows what he s doing  he knows he s michael  a cigar smoking  womanizing  magical arch angel that came down to live with a dying lady and is now in a car with the staff of  the national mirror  and their dog  sparky  on the way to chicago  it then turns into a road trip that s both horrible and great  i don t even think the death scenes    to be exact  make this a tearjerker  the soundtrack is the best with  heaven is my home    up around the bend   and  chains of fools   i have very great expectations about this and i say that it should have had a little more respect in the    s  read my comment  bye,1,
bergman and comedy don t quite go together  some of his comedies are so naff you almost wince  this film has the odd naff moment   the last    seconds being the nadir  but on the whole this is a charming  rather than funny  piece  enjoyable throughout  bergman casts several of his usual suspects who perform well  there is a great scene on the train between david  marianne and an uncouth salesman which will stick in the memory  some of the marriage material is typical  cynical bergman  but this is bergman in a light rather than dark mood   this film has its moments and is worth the    odd minutes  not one of his classics and not the place to start if you want to fall for bergman,1,
tom fontana s unforgettable  oz  is hands down one of the greatest television series ever created  brilliantly written  acted  and directed it is as close to perfection in any art form  film  television  literature  music  as it gets  haunting in it s extreme brutality it creates a prison world filled with diverse characters that range from compassionate to flat out terrifying  it is a show that no matter how brutal it is get through  one cannot take its eyes off of  the combination of professional trained theater actors with film and television actors allows for a range of diverse and all original performances   and while the show is universally praised and has had a loyal fan base  one cannot feel that it was under appreciated during it s television run because of other hbo dramas such as  the sopranos    sex and the city   and  six feet under   and while all those shows are fine and borderline masterpieces in their right  many people forget that it was  oz  that was hbo s first entry into one hour television drama series  it was a brave  risky first entry and with it hbo hit a grand slam with it  this is as good as it gets,1,
mani is back wit a rathnam gem  he manages to capture the mental trauma of a small girl searching   her mother they way he goes about showing the problems in ceylon is a treat      tis movie is a must watch the musical score does enhance the viewing pleasure   rahman a find of rathnam has given some great tunes the lyrics r apt   the movie the locations used for the movie are very good and makes viewing pleasant the movie starts of in a light manner moves over to capture the feelings of the girl finally goes on o shed light into the life of people in war torn places across the world this is yet another classic from manirathnam,1,
this version of david copperfield is dreadful from start to finish  i knew we were in for a wasted evening s viewing when a rather silly to the point of embarrassment attenborough and olivier camp it up as two baddies  it was all downhill after this  aunt betsy was adequate but had none of the eccentric flair she was noted for the worst of the worst was the producer s choice for uriah  this was the music hall version of this character  previously and admirably played by roland young  and what was all this self absorbed angst from david  dickens must have rolled over in his grave to see his favorite child turned into a wimp weeping in his beer   this was one time when hollywood knew more than jolly old england,0,
i guess i was prepared after all the years of hearing about it  first heard about it from siskel and ebert  when they said divine ate excrement  i had to look it up  then a friend told me about it in       she said also that her parents saw it when it first came out and that her mom almost dumped her dad over it  so by the time i caught pink flamingos on sundance today  i was prepared  for the most part   i still couldn t help but be surprised by the anal close ups and the blowjob scene  that said  the only characters i sympathized with were edie and the egg man  her crying scene early in the film  though over something frivolous to normal people  actually makes me sad  though she sure wasn t pretty  she had a cute voice  i was happy for her and the egg man  and they actually touched me   on the other hand  the acting in this poverty level production was not good  and as for the script  just how does john waters come up with this stuff  well  at least it s different,0,
this film should be called adventures in cinemascope  it is like the screenwriter and director tooks the cliff s notes page   outline and decided that this would be a great vehicle for a film about the italian alps  rock hudson is pretty good here  but the dialogue bears no resemblance to hemingway at all  this is a made up version of hemingway  hecht  the screenwriter  is a hack  watch the      version with gary cooper and helen hayes  that is great cinema and was made by someone who understood hemingway and the war in northern italy  gary cooper is very  very good compared to his performance in for whom the bell tolls where he is stiff as a board and thinks he is in a western   anyway  if you are a hemingway fan  do yourself a favor and do not watch this film  your best bet is to get the unabridged audio cd and just listen to one of the greatest novels ever written,0,
this movie is so mild  i tried not to expect anything greater from this film  but still it was a big disappointment  the basic idea of the story is interesting and potential  this could have been so much better  the characters are really simple  no depth at all  it s a shame that previously talented performers tiina lymi and petteri summanen didn t make the already poor characters any better  the director just don t get the watcher emotionally involved at all with this piece of cr p   and the the chase sequence at the end of the movie  that s hideous     why there had to be so stupid and old solution for that situation   it s too much used element with even more terrible way of filming it  oh no,0,
i can t give it less than a star  i tried  at this moment  im not sure if im halfway through it or not  but i stopped actively paying attention around the time part of it was revealed to be a dream  or not  or maybe it was  i think viewers who posted a comment that didn t include the descriptions  horrible  or  awful  or  made me want to swallow a bullet  are probably being nice because it is an indie film  don t listen to them  listen to me  there is no nudity in the movie  skip it  i needed ten lines to submit this warning  so i will also say that the goth girl that some users have described as  hot  is fat  she has fat elephant legs,0,
it s a sad state in corporate hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking routes you ve been seeing in the movie house since day one  i had literally no idea how this film was going to end  because it went left when i expected it to go right  zigged when i expected a zag  etc  this could have easily unraveled into generic suspense thriller  or depressing white trash drama  but it stayed a course all its own till the end  it is a sad story  though  not because of what happens to alice  but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her down this path   the plot has a quiet dignity of form that s usually reserved for theater  but the pacing could use some tightening up  either way  it s a very good film  and for some reason i suspect sour grapes from those who have scored this one low,1,
tug   is absolutely right  although i am sure that mr  osmond wanted to make a sincere  heartwarming christmas movie  this one is as cynical and creepy as they come  the religious significance of christmas is forgotten and replaced with cute kids  clueless grownups  and dopey villains  the production values demonstrate that this was either filmed on a shoestring or by truly inexperienced filmmakers   i suspect the latter  unfortunately  the worst part  oddly enough  really is the music  you would think someone with a long standing musical career could do better than the title song  but you would be wrong  even my mom didn t like this movie  and she likes the osmonds and sappy stuff,0,
movie i have ever seen  actually i find it one of the more entertaining episodes of mst      i have seen  not that it was good  but for anyone who has seen manos  the hands of fate knows this one wasn t two bad  the monster in the movie looked terrible  everyone wore upsetting swim suits  and the plot was laughable  i still don t have a clue as to why they made the monster  they never really gave a good reason  the lead female had to be the scrawniest gal i have ever seen  they would have done better if they cast the gal that was killed at the beginning as the lead  on the plus side the dolphins acting was great,0,
the director of this movie must have been mentally ill or even high     when he accepted to direct this movie        i d rather stare at my ceiling for   hours straight instead of being     punished to watch that stupid movie     my parents make me watch it as punishment           don t watch it     the director of this movie must have been mentally ill or even high     when he accepted to direct this movie        i d rather stare at my ceiling for   hours straight instead of being     punished to watch that stupid movie     my parents make me watch it as punishment           don t watch it     the director of this movie must have been mentally ill or even high     when he accepted to direct this movie        i d rather stare at my ceiling for   hours straight instead of being     punished to watch that stupid movie     my parents make me watch it as punishment           don t watch it,0,
okay  so ghoulies   is kind of bad  and it doesn t really even have the ghoulies in it  and the acting is bad  the storyline is stupid  but i forget to mention how funny this film is  it is so campy  and so ridiculous it is too fun not to enjoy  there are only   ghoulies in the movie  and they don t really seem to be in relation with the ghoulies in the other film  but they are pretty funny  and funny thing  that jonathon graves returns for this one  if you saw the first  he was a character in that  in my opinion  this is better than the first  there are some classic scenes and some classic lines  one which is in a grocery store   attention k mart shoppers   watch this if you enjoy bad movies  it s so bad it is good  and did i mention barbara alyn woods is hot,1,
andaz apna apna is my favorite comedy movie of all time both aamir and salman khan have acted brilliantly while aamir s acting was far better than salman aamir khan is known as  mr  perfectionist  in bollywood and he proves it in every of his film   the story moves around two young guys amar  aamir khan  and prem  salman khan  both are from poor families and are a big dreamer they want to become rich without bearing any pain so when they hear about raveena bajaj  raveena tandon  daughter of mr bajaj paresh rawal  who comes to india to find his bridegroom   they both fool their fathers to marry raveena bajaj and the journey begins there is also a twist in the movie that makes movie even more funny paresh rawal is in double role  teja and mr  bajaj  and has acted brilliantly as he always does shakti kapoor  crime master gogo  also adds a great comedy   this movie is a rib tickling comedy from first minute till last and it is one of classic comedy movies of bollywood,1,
as i said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all time and one of my personal favorites  to me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time  second only to the breakfast club  the last american virgin is also maybe the most honest teen movie of all time  it s underrated and pretty much an unknown movie to a lot of people  it comes on tbs maybe once a year but sometimes longer  the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a few honest scenes  then the second half is pure honest and most of the time serious  with only a few comic scenes  in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time  i ve never heard this many great songs in one movie before  there are   love songs in this movie that i think are some of the best love songs in history  the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin  hes in high school who has a couple of best friends  his two friends are sex sarved teens  the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual misadventures  that are very funny  gary is major in love with the new girl in school  he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her  he also cheats on the side  you can feel the love gary has for this girl very much  you can feel it even more in the second half  gary s friend turns out to be a creep  but his other friend is pretty cool  the movie shows how mean people can be  you can relate to a lot of this movie  the plot sounds like your typcial teen sex comedy  but it s so much more than that  it s a very honest movie  it s also very   ish which i love  if you love the    s or grew up in the    s rent this movie  but there may be some people that don t like the    s but still may like this movie  i first saw this movie back in      i think  it s very entertaining and very funny  it combines very touching moments with very funny moments  it s an underrated gem  i have the movie  i love it  i give the last american virgin        out of,1,
this is definitely one of the better mel brooks movies  along with spaceballs although i will openly admit to not having watched many others  at least yet   it s very silly and thoroughly funny  there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run time  where you aren t entertained  almost all of the gags have a great comical effect  few of them fall flat  i saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing spy hard  and comparing these two spoof movies  i realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is  it s funny from start to finish  none of the comedy is overdone or boring  the music is marvelous  as is the choreography of both dancing and fighting  the acting is pretty much what you would normally expect from this type of movie    elwes is a great comedian  and makes a good robin  the plot is typical robin hood  more or less everything from the legend is fit into this movie and spoofed majorly   if you like mel brooks  or you re just a fan of silly humor  or you re just dying to watch a good parody of the legend of robin hood  this is definitely the film for you  the hbo first look special on the film is also worth watching  and in that  you may want to keep watching throughout the credits  too  i d recommend it to any fan of mel brooks movies  and to people who enjoy silly humor,1,
for several reasons  this movie is simply awful  other posters have listed some of this movie s historical errors  well  i have a layman s knowledge of roman history and even i found the inaccuracies flagrant  i usually forgive errors in historical movies because i understand that the purpose is to entertain not educate  and shrinking a long saga down to a two hour feature requires some  let s say  historical license  but this movie goes well beyond mere rounding   there s worse  to tell a story from a distant period  the movie uses flashbacks which just make the story more confusing  unless viewers have some prior knowledge of the period  they will quickly be lost  in addition  the movie was obviously filmed simultaneously in italian and english with various actors being dubbed later  at times  the actors seem as if they were in completely different movies which were then edited together  in fact  this is not far wrong  the actors were obviously pasted onto a cheesy computer generated ancient rome   the only reason i give this boring mess any stars is because i always find peter o toole entertaining  but that is no reason to rent it  if you are curious about roman history  there are much better movies available,0,
i am the sort of person who never  ever watches animated movies  but i make an exception for thumbelina and the swan princess  being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series  i bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind  determined to love it because i d spent money buying it  i finished the movie  and all i can think is the horror    i wanted to like it  i really did  i tried very  very hard to like it  but i couldn t enjoy a second of this grueling film  the songs made me feel like ripping my ears out of my head  the dialogue was so lame i felt myself twitching with frustration and irritation every time someone opened his or her mouth  the villain was laughable and i felt myself wanting derek and odette to die in the end    and i was absolutely in love with them from the first film   i am going to try repress the memory of this movie  because it almost destroyed the first one for me  there is one song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks to the first film  the difference in animation between the two is made very obvious  and i began yearning for the first one and wishing i d never set eyes on the third   do yourself and favor and don t waste your time,0,
in the dusty little town of furlough in texas  an animal is slaughtering the cattle and the locals  when the teenager tommy  michael carreo  is killed  their friends anna furlough  erika fay   her mexican american boyfriend miguel gonzalez  gabriel gutierrez   jill gillespie  sara erikson  and rosie  martine hughes  finds that a mexican werewolf chupacabra is the killer and they plot a plan to kill the beast    mexican werewolf in texas  is an amateurish crap and among the worse movies i have ever seen  if not the worst  nothing works in this movie  the screenplay is laughable  with some of the most terrible lines i have ever heard  the direction does not exist and the camera follows the  style  of  the blair witch project   the amateurish acting seems to be a prank of high school students or a high school play  the  special effects  are gruesome and extremely poor and the  werewolf  is the cheapest i have ever seen  ed wood movies are cult  but this  mexican werewolf in texas  is pure garbage  in the end  jill says that no man can resist her teats  actually the most beautiful thing in this flick   but i believe the correct quote should be  no man  or woman  can resist to watch this movie to the end   i was driven by my curiosity to see how bad a movie can be and i lost    minutes of my life  but i believe most of the viewers will stop seeing with less than    minutes running time  my vote is one  awful    title  brazil    um lobisomen mexicano no texas    a mexican werewolf in texas,0,
when i saw that icon was on tv  i was surprised  i know that the first clue of where it was headed was the fact that it was on the hallmark channel   has to be said   sorry   i was hopeful when i saw that ff himself was the exec producer but very quickly saw that the only real way that the tv movie and the book were similar were in the name and the character names only  the tv plot was a ho hum to say the least but i concur that in and of itself  the action was worth a   stars  in my personal opinion  mr  swayze could have portrayed a valid monk  however i think that in order to do the movie justice  it would have been a far longer movie  and i don t think hollywood itself would have gone for the plot of discreditation by subterfuge  a case in point is the terrible film version of the sum of all fears   need i say more,0,
this is primarily about love in wwii  yet we must remember that it s also a biopic for dylan thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life   the movie s timing is just great  it really captures what i think would have been the spirit during those times  smiling and hoping you re not going to get bombed  while it may prove boring to some  the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it   at one point  my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax  it really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors  cillian murphy is on fine form here  as is matthew rhys  both are polar opposites and it makes for an interesting watch  the relationship formed between sienna miller and keira knightley s characters is wonderful and we have the acting to thank  and watch out for a cameo by suggs of  madness      despite all of this  it s a rather slow movie  coupled with the fact it s just shy of two hours  it s quite a slog to get to the conclusion   overall  it s a solid non fiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were no doubt helped by the splendid number of well known british names behind the scenes  but it really does drone on for too much at times  still  a worthwhile watch,1,
i disagree with dante portraying the democrat supporting zombies as creatures with an average iq of     i do believe their behaviour should reflect a lower iq than that  something in the order of a pelosi iq    a single digit figure  please   the moh series is quite uneven  and this is the very worst episode  dante  yet another mindless hollywood liberal  or an apolitical nerd who sucks up to the leftist establishment in order to re kindle his pitiful career    must have finally realized that his directorial pursuits had been stuck in a low gear for nearly two decades now  hence came up with this cringe inducing  unsubtle  left wing  satire  of the bush administration  republicans  and capitalism  perhaps he felt he hadn t been overtly political before  he wouldn t exactly be the first no talent to use asinine political propaganda to further his career  when all else fails  the maker of turds such as  piranha    the howling   and  matinee   dante has been as useful a contributor to the horror genre as adolf hitler had been to world peace   th uses lowest common denominator humour  cheap and predictable gags which even the bluest of all blue collar union members wouldn t have trouble understanding  or have you ever seen a clever  subtle  intelligent liberal satire  populist manure has the basest of all messages  hence the language and manner in which this message is communicated has to be as simple and basic as sean penn s name  and what better people to send this message to the popcorn munching sheep than a couple of cocaine sniffing tinseltown losers who ve all fallen so low that they re forced to write for tv     i don t want political propaganda  either left or right  in any type of movie  but placing it in horror   of all genres   is a testament to the endless stupidity that reigns so supreme among hollywood s anti intelligentsia  so vapid was dante that he even failed to notice the hilarious suggestion that zombies would vote democrat     that s what you get for finishing a movie school  not a source of wisdom or useful knowledge by any stretch of the imagination,0,
to sum this story up in a few sentences  a teenage girl  amy  uses her hot body and  supposed  virginity to entice a young troubled guy  matt  with a potential football scholarship to provide her a  full ride  out of town  come to find out she has quite the reputation   has slept with many football players in the past hoping they would offer her the same deal  both of these kids have come from troubled   dysfunctional homes  matt s mothers a alcoholic who repeatedly embarrasses him in front of his friends   amy s mother had a bad reputation herself   got pregnant with amy at a a young age  matt falls in love with amy   tries to straighten out his life for her  very predictable ending  the actress that plays  amy  is actually    years old trying to play a teenager,1,
i just saw this movie and it turns out to be pretty lame just as mentioned by other user reviews and the one thing that bothered me the most was the southern accent some of the characters had  it took place in wisconsin  not the south  as mentioned from other reviews  ed geine wasn t a big dude  so why did the guy that plays jason and leatherface portray him   i fast forwarded through most of it being that there are many slow parts    hopefully someone will do their homework on ed geine and the town and make a more accurate movie,0,
i think there s a reason this film never came close to hitting theaters  it was probably my neighbors down the street who filmed this movie with their mother s video camera  the acting is very amateur  this movie is definitely not something you would want to watch unless you were extremely bored  the actors even seem to double as directors and crew members  with no  professionalism  whatsoever  should the director s  and or actors choose to continue with their endeavor of making movies  i would definitely advise them to brush up on their skills and perhaps take a few  ok  many  classes on film making and acting,0,
sorry randy  i love your comedy but in this case you really laid a  golden turkey  egg   the plot was thinner than a single layer of my skin  the acting more wooden than a giant redwood and i think the direction was non existent   there certainly appeared to be pathetic attempts at take offs of other films  jaws and european vacation to name but two   if memory serves me right eric idle played the same type of character in nat lamp european vacation  but much better   i am wondering if chevy chase and beverley d angelo were approached to make this sequel  if so  they certainly knew what they were doing when they turned their parts down   in my opinion no one can better chevy and beverley in their roles as the griswolds and randy quaid complemented them admirably in the earlier movies   randy quaid should have quit national lampoon whilst he was ahead,0,
oh  boy  it s another comet hitting the earth film  coming within a year or two of deep impact  armageddon  space cowboys and various other stupid flicks with rap stars in them  you d think people would be burned out on this concept  apparently not  since i rented it  hoping it might not be awful  dennis hopper was in it  after all  and he s a good actor  right   i forgot something important  along with peter o toole  robert de niro and quite a few other esteemed actors  hopper has a penchant for appearing in dreadful films  not only that  but he seems to prepare for them by taking forget how to act classes  his performance in tychus is so awful that you expect divine or edith massey to appear in some scenes   i don t know what else to say about this rubbish  other than if you re into things crashing into the earth films  watch deep impact  and then armageddon and space cowboys at a stretch  forget the others altogether  this one really is bottom of the pile,0,
doug mcclure has starred in a few of these british produced genre adventures and this one has got to be the worst of the lot   i know the land that time forgot has its critics but please at least that movie featured location filming and relatively good production values   that s the problem with this movie   the production values go way beyond   so bad they re good   affectionate territory and become   so bad i think i ll go and see what s on the other channels     one case in point is the first scene featuring the intrepid cushing and mcclure encountering a monster   it s painfully obvious the monster is an average sized man dressed up as a rubber monster being made to look over twenty foot tall via overblown back projection   it becomes even more painfully obvious that our heroes are trying to escape the monster by running on the spot   have i mentioned that this is one of the more convincing set pieces   no really this looks like it was filmed in somebody s living room with the spare change left over from that year s doctor who budget   even former doctor who peter cushing is bland and what should have been an amusing line   you can t mesmerise me   i m british   is delivered in a very flat way   a very similar line is spoken by cushing in horror express   in a script devoid of characterisation   plotting and memorable dialogue   it s not just the fact that the dialogue is unmemorable it s also infrequent and rare since the monsters don t speak   wouldn t it have been better having the chief bad guys humanoids like in warlords of atlantis so that they could explain the plot   does anyone here know what the plot actually is     a very tedious british movie that even the twin talents of caroline munro can not save   the whole mood of the movie is summed up by the final sequence featuring two keystone cops,0,
everyonce in a while  kids brings new shows to it s company  for the past few years  they brought pure gold like kirby  right back at ya  or mew mew power  but recenetly   kids has been off  catdog is one of the examples   it s hard to write a negative comment without bashing the show  but in truth  weekenders is pure garbage  it revolves around a group who with an over active brain  the catch though is anything he thinks up comes bad  it may sound good on paper  but after watching it  you ll realize how far from good this show is   the pizza guy is an extremely dumb character  he s very   dimensional  there s really not much to him  he s hyper active  end of story  though many feel all the character are a rip off of the south park  i think just the contrary  mechazawa from cromartie high school is an interesting character  and he s able to make me laugh  tino fail to do either of the two   the cast for the show isn t any better  like tino s mom they suffer from lack of character  they only stick to one characteristic and thats it  the only redeeming quality is the fact that the show can cause you to smirk  whether it s that the scene may actually be funny  or you may just smirk because how stupid it is   thje weekenders is a very crappy show from disney  kids  though it does seem to love some fans  it should really be left to the kids,0,
i really enjoyed this movie for what it is  a funny little film that doesn t take itself too seriously  plot summaries are available everywhere so i won t go into details  michael isn t about a complex plot anyway  it just builds on a great premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful road trip   john travolta s performance as a chain smoking  lady loving  bar brawling  pie eating angel is just perfect  and who doesn t love sparky   watch this if you want to have a few laughs and a overall good time  highly recommended,1,
while i have seen and enjoyed similar movies to this one that were silent films about the russian revolution  such as potemkin and ten days that shook the world  i did not particularly enjoy this one  this was mostly due to the annoying and  artsy  way that the director chose to shoot the film  while potemkin excelled in its editing style  this movie used similar techniques with a lot less finesse  in some places  the editing seemed very choppy and amateurish  plus  and this was truly annoying  the use of zombies throughout the beginning of the film and late in the film really was over the top  what i mean by  zombies  is that to illustrate just how depressed and oppressed the ukranian peasants were  the people stand like mannequins in many scenes  and  they stand like this  unmoving  for a very long period of time  while the  evil  capitalists and exploiters of the masses walk by  gimme a break  this movie is a wonderful example of style over substance  and it s only a movie for those who enjoy or can overlook the overindulgent direction   by the way  the dvd for this film is improved  somewhat  if you leave the audio commentary on  this makes the movie easier to follow and gives a few interesting insights,0,
in his descriptions of caa  platinum card lunches in hollywood  psychoanalysis  a vacation in provincetown he never took  and free trips to nicaragua  financed by columbia pictures   it sounds narcissistic  but spalding gray  possibly because of his unusual personality  ropes the audience in  laughs at himself  perhaps because he did not take the hollywood thing oh so seriously  and gets us to care   this monologue is not just about  the killing fields   or  swimming to cambodia   it is more a pastiche of events  as he sees them  some of the lines are classic  as when gray meets with the esteemed talent agents at caa  the conference table is     full of them  tanned  healthy  fresh from drinking blue green algae from an oregon lake   there are no drugs now in hollywood    this was before the tragedy occurred  many of us will miss his off balance humor,1,
st watched               out of     dir john cassavetes   well done early independent film by cassavetes introduced a style that was much different than what hollywood shows it s audience  this movie also introduced some very taboo subjects  especially the actual racism that probably was prevalent all over the country but was not displayed by the mostly white controlled filmmakers of the time  about the only black actors that had much respect at this time were the ones that acted and displayed personality like whites aka  sidney poitier   besides this  the idea of ending a film without truly concluding the relationships that began leaves many moviegoers dumbfounded but actually makes the viewers realize that life is like this it goes on      i prefer this kind of an ending because it makes you think more about the characters and what may happen next and the conclusions are not just laid out for you  the movie follows the lives of people particulary a couple of people who have a brief relationship and happen to be opposite skin colors  then we watch what happens when the white man realizes what he s done  this is done very well and makes the movie very special  the acting is supposedly done improvisationally which makes the movie even more amazing  i guess you can say i liked this movie  if you can t tell  if you can find it check out this classic early independent film,1,
i remember when this film came out  and watched it a few times on vhs  i was so glad when it was finally released on dvd  i was hoping for widescreen  but at the point would take what was available  i love how they used color in the film  the outdoor scenes are so alive with color  the trees are the greenest i ve ever seen  most of the film was shot in stillwater  minnesota  a beautiful town located on the st  croix river  they must have really scouted locations for filming  because they did a great job  the story is well written  and directed  i would rate this as one of peter horton s best  i m also surprised that andrew dintenfass  the director of photography  hasn t done more  he did an incredible job  the acting also rates up there  it s amazing to see two actors of such a young age pull off this type of film  annabella sciorra did a great job as dexter s mother  who wouldn t want her as a mother,1,
i wish i could tell you that this film is as exciting as the theories it espouses  but i can t  another species could have come and mutated while i waited for some action  for such a controversial man  darwin lived the most conventional life  if you didn t know about the mad theories  you could almost mistake him for a stamp collector   the film makers have cast darwin as a dullard which does him a disservice  even when he briefly loses his mind due to his tireless theorising  it wasn t interesting to watch  maybe great thinkers are dull people  i don t know what i was expecting  a forehead banging eccentric with wild hair and eyes espousing his love of all things simian  the glint of madness straining from a furrowed brow  a long haired hermit who babbled to animals  a head cradling lunatic with eyes lit up like beacons of truth  all of the above would have been great  this is the movies for scorsese s sake   but there was none of that  no lightning  no thunder  no wonder  no awe  just paul bettany and jennifer connelly fresh from the subtle as breath school of method acting  i imagine that someone with darwin s ideas had a brain like a speeding train so why did this film just pootle along   chug chug chug   like a slow winter  the disappointment is immeasurable,0,
i think it was way back in      that we had our exams and my friend and i saw in the papers that one of the theatres was playing  teen deviyan   we decided to go just for the heck of it without hoping anything great  but we were in for a pleasant surprise  the movie was made in      but even by today s standards  the plot was absolutely modern and way ahead of its times  the music was wonderful and dev anand as a city bred looked and acted his best  i still remember that elated feeling when we came out of the theatre after the movie was over    whoever thought of this story of one man falling for three very different girls at the same time  no he is not three timing or fooling them but he genuinely likes all three of them for different reasons  one is homely  one is an actress and the third is a  high society  girl who can also help dev in his career as a poet  the question is which one is the  one  for him  what makes the matter worse is that all three of them like him too  when things come to an impasse  a hypnotist takes him in and in his hypnotized state he dreams of his future with each one of them and reaches the right decision   this dream of his which is the only colored part in an otherwise black n white movie is the crux of the film but surprisingly is edited out from most of the versions available today  if you want to watch this movie make sure that this part is intact  in case you watch this movie without this part and get confused  don t worry because you just watched an incomplete movie,1,
sorry to disagree with you  but i found the dkc series to be quite engaging  so much so that i invested in the snes system and my own copies of the games  this is  mind you  almost ten years after the initial release of dkc    the graphics were ground breaking for their time  the first vector graphics games for home systems  the music and characters are all memorable  and the games brought myself and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment  true  the second game was better than the first  and the third was perhaps lacking the  edge  of the second installment  but all three offered different play  and i enjoy them to this day  by the way  i m old enough to remember when there were no video games whatsoever  and tvs were black and white,0,
this is probably the funniest thing i have ever seen   from start to finish it was perfect in timing  atmosphere  punch lines  background music  fighting sequences and every other possible aspect you can think of  to be absolutely honest i find this movie as funny as their  rik   ade s  sitcom  bottom    maybe even funnier  i laughed constantly throughout the whole movie and can only recommend seeing this film    however  if you watch it without knowing  or liking   the type of comedy rik mayall and ade edmondson has done before  you might not think it s funny at all   but i really can t understand those who dislike it   this is humour folks     people getting hit with frying pans  guys running around wearing red rubber lingerie  green vomit filling the hallways  guys getting kicked in the b      s and getting candlesticks in the eyes   how can this not be funny,1,
the camals are coming is a rather disappointing british comedy from       i purchased this because i like desert adventures and states on the box that it is a drama  it certainly isn t   it is about a couple who head for egypt to capture some desert drug smugglers   this would have been much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy  which lets it down a lot  it is quite silly in parts  depsite this  there are some good action and location scenes   the cast is lead by jack hulbert with anna lee as the love interest   one viewing is enough for this movie  overall  a disappointment   rating    stars out of,0,
this movie was terrible  the plot was terrible and unbelievable  i cannot recommend this movie  where did this movie come from  this movie was not funny and wasted the talent of some great actors and actresses including  gary sinise  kathy bates  joey lauren adams  and jennifer tilly,0,
even people who dislike the film  usually because they find the ending confused  should appreciate the strong acting of elijah wood   joseph mazello who played the two young leads in this movie   spoiler warning  at a literal level  the ending makes no sense  people who think the ending makes some sense at other levels are divided between those who    think the younger brother was killed by the step father either the one time mike  the older boy  was away dealing with the neighborhood gang  or flew off the wishing spot in his wagon to escape the situation through death   those    who think the younger brother is imaginary   his flying off in the wagon transformed into a flying machine signals his overcoming the abusive situation   i favor     it makes a lot of sense in terms of the way many children deal with abusive situations  it is not uncommon for an abused child to split his or her psyche   project the abused self into something else  a stuffed animal  even an imaginary friend  this way  it makes a lot more sense that it is always the younger boy who is abused   never mike  in reality  it is unlikely for one of two brothers to get all the abuse  although that does happen  also  it is bobby  the younger brother who is also the encouraging one  the one who insists that they can overcome the situation  also  the death of a real life sibling through abuse would have been too shattering for an adult with this in his history to transform into as upbeat a fantasy ending as this,1,
this is simply another bad chuck norris movie  norris plays a cop on the trail of a twisted serial killer of women  he put the guy away three years before  but the guy somehow gets through the bars in the nut house he s in by using what looks like dental floss  then the killer escapes in a cleaning van and drives it over a     foot cliff and survives to spend time around a theater undergoing renovation  irish jack o halloran is the best thing in this movie  but like in superman ii  he doesn t say a word  somehow that s supposed to make him more menacing  ron o neal of super fly fame and steve james are wasted playing the city s mayor and norris  sidekick respectively  the film also contains the idiotic subplot of norris and his girlfriend having a child out of wedlock  it s so      s  when coupling norris   serious  acting turn with over the top musical cues signaling every forthcoming scene in predictable fashion  the film becomes a chore to sit through  the build up while searching for the killer in the theater is interesting enough with norris crawling through the shadows to discover the hideaway  but the end fight is disappointing after beginning in such a promising way  it s yet another disappointment from cannon films  and it plays like a movie made for television    of   stars,0,
i ve seen just about all of the coen brothers  films now  and i have to say this is one of their better films  i wouldn t dare say it s better than  the big lebowski   but it was very good in it s own right   i thought the story was very interesting and hilarious at times  i loved all the characters  especially tim blake nelson  delmar  and john turturro s  pete    there really isn t anything bad i can say about this movie  but this movie isn t for everyone  it might be safe to say that if you liked the other coen brothers  films  then you ll hopefully like this one too  and if you liked what you saw in the trailer  i think you ll like the film  but don t hold me to it   anyhow  i hope that you like d  the film as much as i do  thanks for reading    chris,1,
homegrown is one of those movies which sort of fell through the cracks  but deserves better  when i first saw it  i had a luke warm reaction  but  over time  it s really grown on me  no pun intended      the more i see it  the more i appreciate it  the writing is top notch  as is the acting  throw in a few surprising cameos and good direction  and you end up with a great little film   it s also good to finally see hank azaria get a chance to shine in a starring role  and thornton delivers his usual quality performance  even relative newcomer ryan phillippe delivers  playing a friendly innocent with wit and subtlety   on a side note  homegrown is simply a  must see  if you re a billy bob thornton fan  it appears stephen gyllenhaal was influenced by earlier thornton projects like one false move and sling blade  though homegrown is certainly a lot more tongue in cheek than either   and thornton s role as a character who is both sophisticated and down to earth is a perfect match for the actor,1,
the reader is a perfect example of what a short film should be  a poignant story  told simply through well written dialog  beautifully painted images  a score that seamlessly weaves it s way through the narrative  and characters portrayed with thoughtfulness and grace   i saw this film at a festival where other interesting films and ideas were screened  but none of the other shorts had all the elements of great film making coming together in one film as the reader did  the reader commanded the attention of every festival goer in the room and for    minutes took us into the emotional lives of the characters   duncan rogers has created a beautiful film and i hope to see more from this director be it more shorts or perhaps a feature length film,1,
rating       out of        the net  is one of those films that won t remain in your mind till the next one hour  well    just if you keep thinking how bad it is  it s a mediocre  miserable  hollow  laughable and predictable piece of garbage  one of those adjectives i ve just used above is the reason which made me add     a star to the one i would have given  so is it a case of  so bad it is good   no  it s a case of  so bad it is laughable     bullock in a  surprise   very bad performance plays angela bennett  a computer expert who is at home all the time  she works at home  doesn t have any friends and her neighbors don t know her  suddenly  she sees herself involved in dangerous situations  after her colleague dies and the same thing almost happens to her  her identity  bank accounts  etc  etc  etc  are all deleted  and she is now ruth marx  the conspiracy involves even the government and    wait  haven t we seen this before  yes  thousands of times   the net  tries to be modern  to be the portrait of the    s  showing the computer as a villain  big deal  it is a film about nothing  just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes  take the scene of the boat accident  i just laughed when the camera started to get slow     what makes everything even worse here is sandra bullock  how awful she is  has she already made a decent film   a time to kill   okay  but she is still a bad actress  repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures   the vantages and disadvantages of the computer were already shown in        a space odyssey   the best  most intelligent and most complex film ever made  it s not needed to compare  the net  with it  is it      the only reason to see  the net  is to laugh  as i ve said  and to see what it tried to be  the results  well  are a shame   delete this film from your mind,0,
if you decide to watch wild rebels  don t expect anything deep and meaningful  if you re looking for a film that explores the relationships and structure of a motorcycle gang  wild rebels is the wrong movie  if you re looking for an expose on the breakdown of the american educational system and the problem of juvenile delinquency  wild rebels is the wrong movie  if you re looking for a movie that examines how undermanned rural police departments are when facing a well financed  well organized gang  wild rebels is the wrong movie  but if you re looking for an absurd movie filled with scene after scene of unintentional humor  horrendous acting  a paper thin plot  and community theater style production values  wild rebels is the right movie   wild rebels is the story of a down on his luck stock car driver named rod tillman  steve alaimo   after a fiery crash  which rod walks away from completely unscathed despite having only a cotton pants and a london fog style jacket for protection   rod decides to give it up  with no plan for his future other than to wander aimless through the back roads of the south  he stumbles on the satan s angels motorcycle gang  a gang being three of the stupidest guys to ever zip up a leather jacket and a woman they seem to share   this group of hoodlums spends their time terrorizing a rural town in florida by committing such atrocities as stealing a newspaper from a neighbor s mailbox  these bumbling idiots need someone to act as their driver during some larger crimes they have planned  apparently  these three einsteins can only drive vehicles with two tires  not four  so they recruit rod to perform feats of daring that only an experienced stunt driver would be capable of like keeping the car in the middle of a gravel road during a low speed chase  eventually  they hold up a bank  get into the aforementioned low speed chase  and have the lamest gun battle with the police ever put on film  i could go on forever  but you get the idea   i hate the term  so bad it s good   but that seems to aptly describe wild rebels,0,
some famous stories are prone to being moved to another epoch and  as such  becoming an embarrassing tv movie  oscar wilde s canterville ghost is one of them  this tv movie for kids is utterly cheap  concerning acting  character work  credibility  directing and even concerning the modest special effects  as often  the question arises  what was this made for,0,
i just saw this movie for the second time  i first saw it back in the mid    s as a vanguard video selection  it has retained it power   it is interesting from several aspects  one is that it is based on a true story  two is it is a launching pad for two interesting actors  keanu reeves and crispin glover  and three  it has dennis hopper in one of his better social misfit psychotic character roles   the movie is also a study in the way people act in different settings  you have characters in one on one  family  peer group  school  general society settings  etc  the story does well in demonstrating how a person will act in each setting   i wish i could find the details of the actual murder to compare to the movie  i saw a short bit that indicated it occurred in california and that several schoolmates were taken to view the corpse    this is a good choice for a rainy night video rental  be prepared to feel unsettled at the end,1,
great  documentary  of how scientist s believed dinosaurs behaved  captured with some of the most spectacular cgi since  jurassic park   done completely seriously  like a prehistoric episode of  nation geographic   grabs your attention from the first frame and never lets go  my favorite part was when the diplodocus fights off the allosauros      stars  this is what science is all about,1,
my wife and i saw this in the theater when it first came out   there were only   couples there and we all walked out about the same time   this is the only movie i have ever walked out on   it was just painful to sit through   the theater actually stopped us on the way out and asked if we wanted a refund   never had that happen before or since pleae do not rent this you will really regret it i am really sureprised by the vote summary perhaps personal tast has something to do with it,0,
ok where do i start  i saw a screening a couple weeks ago and i was shocked how bad this movie is  sure if you just love beverly hillbillies and green acres  bad acting  and you think they are the best tv shows on air then you will definitely love this movie  me  personally  i really like george s work and he is very talented  but comedy is not his forte  some people are natural in comedy and i am sure he is great   funny to work with personally but comedy he can not pull it off on the big screen  it was a cute movie but would i pay        to see it  h ll no      now that i have seen it i would not recommend it to anyone to spend their money  george  buddy  i love you but please don t do any more comedies  this script is lacking a lot  great concept but just didn t do it,0,
a vampire prince falls for a human girl  unaware that her brother is a famous vampire hunter  that s the underlying theme of this martial arts romp which borrows ideas from  underworld  and  buffy the vampire slayer  but manages to maintain a style of its own  i was bemused by the uk and hong kong title  the twins effect  as there are no twins involved in the story  it turns out that the two main female characters are played by hong kong pop stars who perform as  the twins   don t let this put you off  these girls can act  at least well enough for this type of film  and add a lot of charm to the proceedings  jackie chan turns up for a couple of cameo appearances adding a dash of his own brand of slapstick mayhem to the proceedings  all in all this is great fun for those who like their vampires served up with a helping of tongue in cheek humour,1,
this is a woeful hollywood remake of a classic british film  everything that made the original  italian job  entertaining has been bled out of this festering sore of a movie  scripted  by donna and wayne powers and listlessly  directed  by f gary gray  i am amazed that troy kennedy martin  the screenwriter of the original film  allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pig s ear  martin has worked on some of the finest film and tv projects of the last    odd years  even being vaguely associated with this stinker is not a good thing   the humour is forced  the drama is laboured  all the characters are cookie cutter likable crims  with the exception of charlize theron s implausible  beautiful safe cracker rally driver and the plot only matches the original on the following points       three minis  the modern bmw made versions  but minis nonetheless       use of the names croker and bridger for   of the main characters      disrupting a city s traffic control system to provide a safe route through it       er  that s it   otherwise  what you get is a bland and implausible american by the numbers heist movie in which a gang of jolly pirate chums eventually get the better of their evil associate  believe me  it feels like an awful long time before they do  the cast do their best with what they re given but it seems that they all accepted it as a turd polishing exercise after reading the script  none of the original film s quirky nature and distinctly british flavour has survived being fed into the hollywood hamburger machine    do yourself a favour and watch the original      movie instead of this sucking chest wound  it s a wonder that noel coward hasn t done an aunt nelly  jumped out of his grave and kicked the teeth of everyone involved in this tepid remake halfway down their throats   italian job  more like italian jobbie,0,
i always wanted to see this film and when i finally got to i knew i was in for a nice surprise when john boorman s name appeared on the screen  known mostly for his epic films  he directed the first conan and wrote apocalypse now  put together in the classic hollywood structure  this one fits nicely with his catalog   i also can t express how perfect the timing was considering that myanmar  burma  is once again experiencing an uprising by monks and students against the military  junta  run government which is the very same one  there has been a change of leadership since but it s essentially the same  depicted in the movie from       now more than ever this film needs to be aired on television  caught it on ifc  because of recent events,1,
i could not watch more than    minutes of this movie  it has set the standard  i will never again give a movie a    unless it was as horrible as this one  i fully agree with the other comments about this film  but  since i m dutch  i watched it with dutch translation  apparently  they didn t have money for a proper translation  so they decided to babelfish it  with sometimes hilarious results   don t smoke  don t drink  don t do drugs  don t watch demon summer   i was surprised that the actors  wow  i can t believe i just said that   didn t hold the script  was there any   in their hands while shooting  i think they also did a good job on    well    uhmm    no  they didn t do a good job at all,0,
walking with dinosaurs is an amazing documentary  educational for both the ignorant of dinosaurs and dinosaur lovers  like myself  alike  i admit  i was very young when i saw this on discovery  but i was obsessed with it immediately   spoliers       the series contains   episodes  going from the late triassic when dinosaurs were just first evolving to the late cretaceous  at the end of reign of the dinosaurs  when i first saw this film  it was like i really had traveled back in time  the majesty of the diplodocus  the adventures of opthalmosaurus  and the caring mother version of t rex all astounded my family and me  it is an amazing film  and i believe that bbc managed to do just what they set out to do  awesome job,1,
here s another of the      s westerns that i watch whenever it comes on tcm or fmc  because although it may be flawed historically  it is extremely entertaining and well acted  plus it s got randolph scott  my favorite actor second only to gary cooper well  ok  fourth behind coop  charlton heston  and gregory peck  but the film itself  to me anyway  is reasonably historically accurate and as i said before  well acted and  flows  very well i bet i ve seen it    or    times  and enjoy each viewing more than the one before  i have it on tape from tcm but would buy it in a minute if it ever came out on dvd  see it if you haven t  i guarantee you ll like it,1,

the      version of  psycho  needed to be set back in the    s  rather than present day  the headliners would have done a good job with the setting  there were two scenes that just stuck out like a sore thumb  the first one was at the beginning of the movie when marian crane  anne heche  was sitting at her desk  her boss took his client into his office because  it was air conditioning   i imagine that the majority of arizona businesses have air conditioning  the other was the meeting of lila crane  julianne moore    sam loomis  viggo mortensen   lila sporting the walkman seemed like an exaggeration to update the movie  the movie did spook a number of the viewers in the theater,0,
this is speculation  this movie could of inspired paramount pictures to film the movie the core  both movies have something in common nature the only improvement for inferno is a better cast  inferno s cast is still good though  excellent movie   out of     this is worth watching  this movie does have truth to it heat waves are real  another piece of truth is heat related power outages  where i live i have actually heard transformers blow  unrest from heat is possible because people seeking to cool off may get rowdy  there is a considerable amount of team work in this movie  again this a movie worth watching  the movie has a good cast  the movie has no slow spots,1,
hard justice is an excellent action movie  the whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting  for the people who say they don t make shoot em ups like they use to  well  this one is really hard core  david bradley is really good and his character takes a pounding in the movie  he gets hit by the stick over a dozen times  gets stabbed in the back and is in a coma for three days and then wakes up and fights again  gets beat up  recovers and is ready for more action  his character is incredibly tuff  charles napier was very good as well and he arguably steals the show  vernen wells was good  professor toru tanaka had a short and an uncredited role in hard justice  as for the action  it is truly awesome with all of the gun fights and the huge stand off like scene in the beginning has cars getting blown up and flipping up in mid air  there is so much that happens in the    minute run time  for the action fans you will be blown away by all of the fire power and fighting that this film has to offer  hard justice is a movie that isn t easy to locate and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale buy it up because this movie is big keeper an d plus the box is cool  there is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed  look and see if you can find some good deals on ebay  half com  amazon com s z shops and market place sellers  i strongly recommend that any action movie fan who loves shoot ems and fighting movies and has been disappointed by other movies that have the look like a true non stop action flick but fails to deliver it to get hard justice,1,
are you kidding me  the music was so loud in this show i could often not even hear the dialog  and the music was nothing great  anyone know what jake s mother said when he walked in the door    and the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to have so little instant devastation  anyone research the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this one  i felt like a bunch of sit com actors were sent on location and didn t know what to do with dramatic dialog  and what does a kansas teen know about shopping in soho    couldn t we have had a better line here  was bored to tears and only kept awake by the jarring blare of the over mixed way to loud music,0,
if you need a clue as to whether playmaker is decent or not  look to its star  colin firth  who refers to it in an interview as  absolute rubbish    i sincerely hope no one ever sees it    the script and plot are ludicrous  the female lead is unconvincing  the only thing worthwhile is colin firth  and he seems slightly embarrassed throughout   for diehard firth fans only    the shower scene alone is worth the       you might have to shell out  should you find it in a video cutout bin like i did   i m happy for mr  firth that his days of taking projects like this one are over,0,
a few bratty kids unwittingly unleash an evil that has lain dormant for the past twenty years and have to reap the ill fortune that comes with that the campbell brothers  film before this  midnight skater  was fun   their picture after  the red skulls  was all right  so why is  demon summer  so mind numbingly bad  i really don t know  it is better then their  splatter rampage wrestling  but not be much as the basement level of acting is cringe worthy and when a  horror  film is as talky as this one is  that s not a good thing  the story s been done to death in many other better films  so why waste your time on this one    my grade  d,0,
first  let me say that although i generally appreciate mike judge s work  i ve been merely tepid in my response to office space  king of the hill  and beavis and butthead  i generally prefer more intelligent comedy  and therein lies the irony with respect to idiocracy   in a future world where the embodiment of beavis and butthead s views  basest instincts  and intellectual capacities are the framework of a chaotic  messy  semi mad max semi blade runner society  where every trailer trash guy s fantasy becomes reality  a man with even average intelligence is threatening and accused of talking gay  and the mob mentality takes over  and this world is also incredibly funny   yes  it s obvious that carl s jr   starbucks  costco and fuddruckers executives will be horrified at the twisted values given their products in the year        there were some missed opportunities with the film  and the relationship between the time travelers   the other being an average intelligence woman who s worried about her boyfriend s  pimp s  retribution   could have been stronger  the chemistry is there  and there don t seem to be too many women in the future   i did leave with a grin on my face  but the experience is a bit better than the memories  thus  it s my kind of popcorn film  and it will be fun to revisit on video  recommended  fyi stay through the credits for an extra scene,1,
me and my friend read the summery and watched the trailer and were very interested and excited to go rent this movie  bad idea  we thought a movie with actors that influential would have been a sure hit  but our expectations fell extremely short  first of all  the trailer and summery are misleading to the point of lies  the movie started out slow for the first       hours reminder  its about two hours long  and when it finally started to gain momentum  it sucked  plus  the plots were very hard to follow  it confused us because it kept skipping from one story to another in random order  the characters where not very realistic when it came to reality  sure the mum and son could be actual people in reality  but everyone else seemed to be one extreme or the other  if your a person who likes sick  twisted  unusual movies  then go for it  but we advise not wasting two hours of you life you cant get back  unfortunitly  no one told us that,0,
featuring some amazing and wonderful characters  a new mythology  superbly designed and executed sets  nightbreed is a great film   sadly the lack of a well known lead actor lead to the film finding obscurity   perhaps also the homosexuality of the director lead to the film being unwittingly censored by the white audience the film decries   none the less the film is a treasure of the monster movie superhero genre   a sequel featuring highlander style flashbacks to different epochs in history would be interesting    another idea would be the foundation of the new midian  perhaps in texas somewhere or the swamps of lousiana with crocodile men and a traveling freak circus,1,
jimmy wang yu  an authentic asian superstar  directed and wrote this film which i have only seen in a dubbed videotape version  the widescreen  shaw scope  shape was lost and the original actor s voices absent but this is still good to watch  the story is the usual martial arts school fights villains from japan plot with our young hero winning out in the end by beating up loads of assorted thugs   the combat gets better as the film unravels  early in the film it looks stiff and dull but later there is a great scene where wang yu fights hordes in a gambling joint then walks out into a snowy scene and takes some more villains on with knives  sword and fists  that part is very exciting   quite good then but it would be interesting to see a non dubbed widescreen version if there is one,1,
interesting premise  interestingly worked out  the strongest feature of this film is the emotional tension of the astronaut who knows a truth  but is unable to convey it to others  overlook the weaknesses and just enjoy the movie  but be prepared for a certain level of suspense,1,
i will admit that this movie was awful  cheesy  sexist  badly dubbed  and poorly edited  but i loved it anyway  i first saw this movie when i was     and it has stuck with me ever since  fyi  this is very close to hard core porn as i remember  it certainly got my juices flowing  this flick gives a whole new meaning to swedish erotica  it is a humourous take on human sexuality as seen by hot randy female aliens who are  i think  just looking for some spermatozoa for their dying race,1,
river queen s sound recordist should have been fired  in this day and age there is no excuse for poor recording on the set  mumbling voices was the end result  and the cinematography was average to fair at best  the story had potential and i feel sorry for the overseas actors who must have known they were on a turkey shoot while they were filming  its obvious that the movie was suffering from el cheapo budget syndrome  and the scene where temuera is procreating inside the house while a battle rages outside is just too stupid for words    i noticed a few shortcuts taken on the maori protocol side of things  but this was probably due to movie length time restraints etc  all in all i wasn t impressed with this movie  the whanganui river has many beautiful spots but this movie gives us a cold  drab and claustrophobic image  with none of the beauty  the movie needed more sunshine and better camera angles  less on screen confusion  better sound recording  and more thought needed to be put into what the movie goers would be seeing on the big screen    hats off to all involved though for completing what must have been a very difficult shoo  i have the utmost appreciation for anyone who can make a feature film  sadly i did not enjoy this one,0,
the directing is brilliant  the casting is remarkable  though i would ve loved to have seen a little more of aaron lustig  from y   r fame   who played paul shaffer   i only have two minor quips about the film  as subtle as they are  one  roebuck s leno is excellent  but his stage presence  i e  during what appears the taping of one of his late show episodes  is a tad underwhelming  two  the distribution of the foul language  i am willing to tolerate foul language  so long as it is not used gratuitously  and to a degree  the film was gratuitous  the language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce the pathos of bates  otherwise well portrayed kushnick by her frequent use of it  and served to make roebuck s leno a goody goody by his lack of use of it  of course  if the characters really did behave this way  kudos to everybody   nonetheless  the piece is an excellent one  as far as television and video are concerned  the film  i feel  had potential for the big screen  but would ve required re casting for the bit parts  and probably a different director  as well  the aesthetic feel is that of the larry sanders show  good for hbo  mediocre for cinematic purposes,1,
surface is one of the greatest t v  series i have seen  the acting is great and the storyline enthralling  each episode left me barely able to wait to watch the next  i especially thought carter jenkins who played miles bennett did a superb job   he is a very talented actor and i look forward to seeing more of his work    i can t believe surface only made one season   once again the public has let me down  it is hard to fathom that a great shows like this one would get canceled  while crap reality shows continue on year after year  whoever made the decision to cancel this show really dropped the ball on this one,1,
the impossibly sexy rosie holotik plays charlotte beale  a new nurse at one of those movie type asylums where the doctor in charge has his own  unorthodox ways of treating the inmates  reluctantly bringing her on board is the officious dr  masters  anne macadams  a k a  annabelle weenick   the inmates don t take too kindly to charlotte  either   part mystery  part horror  this initial effort from b movie director s f  brownrigg has an oppressive feel to it  these colorful psychos  including a nymphomaniac with no self esteem  a gentle giant who s already had a lobotomy  and a supposed  judge  who speaks in legalese jargon  dominate the screen with their unnerving presence   it s a picture that works fairly well  establishing the gritty  grim atmosphere right from the get go  some brief bursts of graphic violence also help to give it that good old fashioned exploitative quality   it builds in intensity as the imperiled heroine struggles to maintain her own sanity  offering one surreal encounter after another  particularly effective is the poetry quoting  dotty old mrs  callingham   for cheap      s era cheese  it s pretty effective  with a particularly nasty climax  i had a pretty good time watching it,1,
those prophetic words were spoken by william holden  as a war reporter  to the beauteous jennifer jones  as a eurasian doctor   explaining his failing marriage on the beach  they start an affair  despite huge odds of adultery and racial issues  in hollywood of the     s  interracial romance was allowed but only with dire consequences at the end  beautiful hong kong scenery  although some beach scenes look studio bound   a famous title tune  poetic script  lovely background music  by alfred newman   great costumes  outstanding performances  especially jones  directed here by henry king  who also did  the song of bernadette         an oscar for jones  still make this a world class romance weeper,1,
the brilliance of this film lies not in the filmmaking process  which is a conventional  but executed  intertwining tale of the lies of three servicemen post wwii  but in the fact that this story was told at all  samuel goldwyn deserves credit for having the chutzpah to push through a film who has for its leads a disabled vet with pincers for hands  an alcoholic  and an underachiever,1,
this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end  not that that is bad  it was done to illustrate character trait degression of the main character  consequently  if you are not into tragedies  this is not your movie  it is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile  if you liked dostoyevsky s  crime and punishment   you will probably like this if only for the comparisons  the intriguing question that the movie prompts is   what is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publicly aproved ideas for another set   the new ideas are quite opposed to the status quo if you are a conservative you will not like this movie    besides other philosophical questions  i must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well  the grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start  also  there was use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters  if these sorts of things do not impress you  skip it  overall i give this movie a,1,
radio  is a beautiful movie based on a real story of the mentally challenged james robert kennedy  nicknamed  radio   and the football coach from the t l  hanna high school  harold jones   cuba gooding  jr  is excellent as radio  i would never imagine to see him in a serious performance  specially because most of the movies i watch with him are comedies  ed harris is great as harold jones  but this actor is great  so this is not anything new   the mentally challenged young man called james robert kennedy  always walk around the t l  hanna high school  without bothering anyone and almost not noticed  one day  when the football s ball is throw near him  he decides to stay with the ball  for the impatience of johnny cash  one of the best players from the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you would ever met  one day  cash decides to punish james  mocking him with other football players and even go so far as to tie him up   when coach jones discovers that horrible act  he stays angry and punish all the team  deciding for this day on to help james  who gets the nickname  radio  because of his passion for radios in general   the movie shows how radio becomes an adept assistant  helping the team train despite hardships from the players  and even getting respect from basically all the people who lives in the small city    i would recommend this movie for everybody who wants to watch a real and beautiful story  it has a life lesson specially showing us how a person can make a difference  even not being what we call   normal    radio has a big heart and is incapable to hate anyone  and that s a thing that we all should apply to our daily lives,1,
just like most people  i couldn t wait to see this ocean s    sequel but it really stinks  i must say  it stinks because there s simply no good screenplay it was just cheap  i hope the producers donate all the money this movie has made  or will make  to the tsunami victims in asia so this movie will have at least one good reason to exist  it is so bad i even can t write a decent comment about it but    i still advise the creators of this thing to make  ocean s      ocean s    will be about the same thieves who are trying to steal a screenplay well hidden somewhere in hollywood  the   th member will be a foreign  maybe russian  screenplay writer who knows all tricks to write a copy of this well hidden screenplay  so they can replace the original they ll have to steal  or they need to find at least    people to write a decent screenplay for a movie in which not only julia roberts plays herself but even all other star members of the ocean s films     people because it s the lucky number of andy garcia s character,0,
awkward disaster mishmash has a team of scavengers coming across the overturned s s  poseidon  hoping to loot it before it goes under for good  irwin allen s sequel to his      blockbuster  the poseidon adventure  arrived in theaters seven years later  never mind that nobody cared anymore  why give us such a shoddy production  filled with dim characters and miscast actors  only to trash the memory of your biggest hit  one might end up feeling really sorry for michael caine  sally field  peter boyle  jack warden  karl malden and shirley jones were it not for their lost at sea expressions  good for a few stray laughs   there s a moment when saintly jones is tempted into taking some treasures just for herself and she timidly starts stuffing her pockets that is an unintended hoot  the film was a career bungler for all concerned  most especially allen  who never quite recovered from this    from,0,
i saw this movie in blockbuster and thought it might be a good sunday evening movie when there is nothing else to do  so i bought it used    dvds for      although it was cheap  my money would have been better spent on a nail to drive through my foot   the film started out nicely  kinda dark and mysterious  i was always enthralled with vampire and samurai movies as a kid  i thought the combo would be really cool  the first fight scene was pretty cool  i was excited for the rest of the movie  then the movie took a serious nose dive   i understand that this was a big hit in the east  i guess because of the twins  i don t see it though  this movie  aside from the first    minutes  was absolutely horrible  so many movies in this genre have the potential to be great  and blow it terribly  this is just another casualty   jacki chan s role in this film doesn t make any sense at all  whyyyyyyyy  complete silliness  he probably made a few bucks off it though   the only cool thing in this movie are the swords they use  nice idea   i wouldn t recommend this movie to anyone,0,
contains spoilers i had it recorded a while ago when it was on pbs but never got a chance to watch it  probably due to prejudice about having to sit through     hrs of masterpiece theater  with its bbc made for tv production style  no music  settings all in one room  no outdoor scenes flat tv look      but after watching the movie traffic  which i thought was pretty good at that time   i couldn t help digging up the traffik tape to see what else could they have dwelled into with the extra       hr   boy  was my preconceptions wrong about this tv series  it is so much more involving than traffic  the characters are fleshed out better so that their actions are more believable  and the whole subplot involving pakistan completes the whole point of view of everyone in the whole supply chain  from the farmer to the end user  in traffic  the pakistan story was rewritten and reduced down to a good cop vs bad cop plot   there was alot more meaningful discussion and debate about alcohol and other forms of drug  whereas in traffic they mostly became passing references of no significance  same with social issues  which in traffik  were conveyed realistically w o sounding preachy  whereas in traffic  the characters jus t blurted it out as a statement like the way they do it in those made for tv  issue of the week  movies   there was no bad guy vs good guy in traffik  even the dealer is portrayed as a junkie that sells to support his habit instead of the  nobody messes with me  type of person in traffic   the only down part is that since i watched traffic not much before watching this  it was hard not to compare scene by scene  and even though the scenes were not the same  i knew what the outcome was going to be already  thank god for the pakistan story  which is different enough that it allowed me to enjoy it completely w o thinking which scene it compares to  although i was thrown off thinking the drugs were fused into the ceramic of the statues in which helen brought back to germany  as in the storyline of traffic   thank god traffik was not that hokey and far fetched,1,
tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films i ve seen recently  in the end there is no actual supernatural element  despite what one is led to expect throughout the film  the story seems to be about two sisters  who  upon returning to their father s home after some sort of absence  later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution  are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them she s prepared a special dinner at another time   but some presence as yet unexplained  it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead  and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister  who was unable to save her  and her step mother  who was callous enough to let her die  much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film  but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion  definitely not light viewing  watch this one when you really want to think about what you ve seen  it s a hell of a puzzler,1,
german born turkish director faith akin captures in his film the endless variety of the different styles in music and songs in istanbul  a city that is a bridge between east and west  a city that is uniquely located on both sides of the bosporus  in europe and in asia  kurdish dirges represented by aynur  who performs her own brand of kurdish gospel music  passionate and melodic  we are introduced to romany instrumentals  to orhan gencebay  who has been called the elvis of arabesque music   sounds of music are heard everywhere in the city as faith akin takes us into underground clubs  to the street performers  and to recording sessions  german bassist alexander hacke who comes to istanbul to play and to learn about turkish music quotes confucius   to understand the place  you have to listen to the music it plays   akin s fine documentary does just that   gives us    minutes of music that helps to cross the bridges  for me  watching the movie was especially interesting because i recently visited istanbul as a part of my vacation and spent four days there  the city fascinated me by its images  colors  crowds  vibrancy and visual beauty  now  i can add the sounds of music to the ever changing portrait of istanbul,1,
the duo of abbott and costello lives on in this version of a story time classic  in  jack and the beanstalk   there s everything to see  music  magic  and comedy rolled into one  costello play plays jack after he listens to the story being told by a young boy one time  we know jack was a poor boy who sells his cow  dolly  for   magic beans  well  he plants those   beans  and they were indeed  magic  he climbs to the sky  sees a big castle there  and he would sing a song  unknown he would encounter the giant buddy baer   not only him  he would dance with the woman who was also a giant  she would clobber jack with her elbows during the dance  that was funny  you got the playing harp who knows how to put the giant as ease  the goose who lays golden eggs  and my favorite  the way jack gets rid of the giant  he gets the ax  and started chopping down on the beanstalk  another funny is where the ax got stuck during the chop  and the final celebration happens when the people dance around the imprint where the giant fell  a lot of fun  and fun for the whole family as well  very recommended    stars,1,
as with many of wong s films  a lot of people find them to be boring and confusing  well i like them and i like this film too  i went out and rented it on dvd and i watched it   times  it is a very subtle movie that provides an intoxicating experience  for those who did not enjoy it       you just wasted   hours of your life     too bad   muhahahahaha,1,
i started to watch this show by accident  but i love it  the fact that main character is in a wheelchair is something that lacking in television  especially for kids shows  my five year old nephew  as most children do  would just stare at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of handicap but after he watched pelswick it just seemed to be a normal occurrence to him  every time he saw a wheelchair he would simply say  like pelswick  and go on with what ever he was originally doing  and yes the animation is a little crude  but if you can stand to watch through the first season of the simpsons then this isn t that bad  the  genie  is actually an angel who is there to help pelswick learn lessons in life  he can not walk some else said he could walk some of the time  i ve seen every episode and he never to my recollection walked  he is a paraplegic he has no feeling below his armpits  he mentions it in an episode   as for the humor if you can get a copy of the  ntalented  episode  which lampoons boy bands  you will instantly love this show,1,
i have to ask myself  do movies like this get their support by people associated with the movie itself coming here and critiquing it  how can something so awful score this high  my parents went to see a lot of the more adult themed movies when we were kids  anything with an r in it until we were old enough  i only remember two films that had them saying yech  when they got home  this one  and  catch       the movie is comprised of bumbling physicians and staff in a filthy hospital  rambling narratives  and a pack of inner city people  who look like rejects from a     s norman lear sitcom  staging a protest  the worst part is the  murder mystery   a crazy old guy doing  god s work  by killing doctors and others  when he confesses  scott and his girlfriend show little emotion  they only care about him getting out of there where he will  be safe and happy   a doctor that drops dead of a heart attack is faked as the man so he can get away  oh  my  what a fun movie   this movie didn t  make me think   chuckle  or have any other feeling other than  it must get better   but it never does  people wonder why it was a failure  no wonder here  i wonder how imdb has enough members that think this movie is good  yech,0,
i realize a period piece is expensive to make  and that this style of shooting  close framed shots to camera  moving camera  wide aperture shots  washed out  allows such films to be made for a price  as a style  it has advantages and disadvantages like any other  it allows more period pieces to be made  like any style it has its detractors and supporters   there are probably even those that believe that this manner of shooting has an artistic basis   if only some of the money saved  could have been spent on the script for whatever style is used  a film needs good writing and good acting   the acting in this film is mostly very good  the writing less so  it is composed of a collection of bits taken from the book and much which is relevant to the plot is left out making for a disjointed collection of scenes with little or no continuity   if you have read the book  do not under any circumstances watch it  if you have not read the book  are easily pleased and have nothing better to do there is no harm in watching it  but be prepared to be disappointed   it could have been so much better,0,
this film could cure sleep disorders  thats how bad it is  the story dragged  and the bad guy is not that scary  you will not even see this one on tbs reruns  this film made me wonder about chuck film choices  he work on a real dog with this one,0,
there is more to this movie than meets the eye  if you re looking for groundbreaking originality or easy comedy  you ll be disappointed  but for an entertaining    minutes  this is just fine   the cinematography is careful and precise  the sex scenes  which one comment decries as gratuitous  are anything but   every gesture contributes to the development of the characters   yes  some of the main characters are not exactly lovable human beings  but the movie makes an honest effort at showing their interactions in an honest light  without being sensationalistic  at least not for early   st century urban standards   and there are many very amusing moments,1,
one of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is pudovkin s short  chess fever   a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies  such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short  two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background  a painted set  this is in contrast to earlier lumiere shorts such as  l arrosseur arrosse  or  repas du bebe   wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting  the difference in activities  natural feeding baby  watering garden  artificial chess  is possibly significant   the main contrast in this film is between this immoveable background and the placid  serene game of chess  and the fierce passions this latter causes  as accusations of cheating lead to a most undignified melee  the intellectual game becomes a gross physical scrap  just as the pretensions of arty filmmakers are forever deflated by the  cruder  demands of audiences   what is most amusing about the film is not neccessarily this descent into slapstick  but the way it is filmed  its prolonging long after the initial joke has been made  the way the camera refuses to dignify the fight with anything like attention  focusing instead on the set  while we catch glimpses of hurling feet and dislodged clothing  the film s refusal to edit is audacious  so that the humour seems to arise from something else other than the fight  reflecting our need for physical contact over intellectual stimulation  our unwillngness to let go   what is especially brilliant is the denouement  as these upper class fops are caught by the valet  who picks them up like two errant schoolboys  as if he is about to box their ears  if masters can t be expected to keep their place with decorum  than somebody s going to have to do it for them,1,
when i was young  i was a big fan of the naked gun movies but just recently i watched the show police sqaud  and i think its great  leslie nielson s awesome  alan north is cool  and who the heck is rex hamilton  but anyways  it s one goofy show   one of my favorite parts of this show when they do the freeze frame scene during the end credits  i think my favorite one is when norberg  not o j   walks in during the scene and he tries to fit in with the freeze frame  classic   the only problem to me is the cigarette gag gets very old  when drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks   cigarette   and the person replies   yes  i know    i think they used it too many times by whatever   good acting  good gags  great show,1,

being a huge fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this film i was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute roller coaster ride      alas   where to start on this mess i think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funny i was still waiting for the first laugh after a good    minutes of viewing many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cut   the overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the  terrible  guest house the   buffoons attempt to run but to me its just puts an even higher dampener on a sorry state of filming that should never have been created   the acting at times is pathetic fenella fielding is wasted as the loony mrs foxfur and i ve seen simon pegg have much better outings   i d recommend guest house paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much more but to any bottom fan who hasn t seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned,0,
the dreams of karim hussain are to be feared  when the right hemisphere of his characters overpowers the left  shocking images of blood  dismemberment  and various abominations are released  religion won t save you  nor will mother nature or your own family  hussain s dark poetry  because that s what this film really is  destabalizes all institutions of sanctuary    subconcious cruelty  is a current crowd pleaser on the horror fantasy festival circuit  the film s opening meditation on madness is both well written and profound  the protagonist s desire to profane the birthing process which brought him into the hell he inhabits unfolds with horrific and credible illogic  from here the film continues deeper into the subconcious and tackles mother nature  hussain offers depictions of lusty pagan fertility and writhing mushroom madness  nature is exposed as blood drenched and violent in hussain s frightening enlightenment    subconcious cruelty  is disturbing to all and rewarding to those who see past the shock into the mature themes of life  lust and madness this very worthy film explores  cj goldman deserves kudos for his special make up  as do david kristian for unnerving sound design and teruhiko suzuki for score,1,
this film was very interesting to me  virtually a film within a film  which is about a very whimsical director who cleverly persuades an actress and and actor  who happen to dislike each other  in producing sexual chemistry on film  the director is faced with a fusillade of obstacles as she tries to get the two individuals to perform beautifully on film  sex is comedy is much more than a comedy  packed with uncomfortable quirky moments the movie also addresses the psychological and innate instinctual behavior of men and women in regards to the sometimes controversial act of sex  i loved this film  the character jeanne played by the beautiful anne parillaud performs wonderfully on screen as you share in her struggle to produce a motion picture work of art,1,
make sure you make this delightful comedy part of your holiday season  if you admire dennis morgan or barbara stanwyck  this film is a fun one to watch  they really work well together as you would see in this movie  the whole cast was very entertaining  since i m a dennis morgan fan  this film was a real treat  but   everyone can enjoy it  recommended,1,
yes this movie is obviously trying to be a conan the barbarian  and what amazes me is that this is a sequel  the people demanded another one    the first part of the flick is a flashback showing the original  from what i saw it doesn t look worth checking out  and apparently ator always kills a huge puppet in his movies   well now ator lives at the ends of the earth with his mute sidekick thong  a girl seeks his help as this evil dude has her father in his custody  let me just say this bad guy is extremely patient as the old guy constantly insults the villian and just prattles on endlessly  the bad guy waits to the very end of the movie and finally smacks the old guy around leaving you to wonder  what took him so long to snap    meanwhile  ator and his sidekick and the gal go through one adventure after another  they fight cavemen  invisible soldiers  don t ask   rent a thugs  and people who worship snakes  ator also battles a giant snake puppet and hang glides  again  don t ask   all the while you will be thinking that conan would kick ator s butt,0,
gzsz is the longest running daily soap in germany and it s cult  i started watching it from the first day on and i got hooked on it right from the start  over the years so much has changed  the old characters like heiko  elke  tina  saskia etc  left  and new ones appeared like marie  kai  cora or john  i have to say that i liked gzsz better in the years           because today the show focuses too much on the younger characters  my favorite character is sonja wiebe because she is the most scheming person that has ever been on that soap and she is also one of the most interesting characters on the show  tina bordihn was great as the first sonja but as tokessa became the recast of sonja the character got even better,1,
do not rent this movie  i ended up buying the  previously viewed  tape of this for        that was close to the price of a rental  so thought  i might as well buy it  i m tossing it out after i finish this review  the movie which stars lowe  is a music video with few lines of dialogue  slow moving shots and poorly done editing  i thought i d be seeing a mindless action flick  which is what i wanted to see  i didn t even get that  this movie is an exercise in slow moving shots  no script  close ups  terrible edited  and a poorly developed plot  i can t believe that is actually ends with a scene in which they think the audience cares about the characters  by the end of the movie  we still don t even really know who they are  believe the hype  stay away,0,
this is such a crappy movie i have no idea how it got on the shelves  they must have paid the movie store to make them put it there  seriously  the story makes absolutely no sense unless you are on some seriously heavy drugs  you would definitely have to be on something in order to watch this total piece of garbage  so much so that you would not care what was on the tv because you re almost in a coma  the writing sounds like it was done by a   year old and the acting is worse than grade school plays  the hideous special effects they were trying to do look so stupid  what did they spend a whole    to make the entire movie  it looks like it  oh my  that scene with the old woman who has an    s hairdo and the ugly girls in the rubber suits  me and my friends laughed so hard  did someone actually think it was a good idea to make this into a movie  i find that hard to believe,0,
for all the viewers who have seen  the cure  would agree with me on this comment that it is a superb movie and is very heartwarming  joseph mazzello and brad renfro prove their star quality in this movie  along with dexter s  mazzello  mother annabella sciorra   when i first watched the cure on tv  i didn t know what to expect  but as i watched this masterpiece it soon became clear what it was about  dexter an    year old boy who is plagued with aids  sits around his backyard playing with his toys when one day he meets his next door neighbour eric  which at first is a little awkward for the   boys  but they soon became good friends   during the film  i kept wondering what would happen to the two boys  as they kept me wondering  i wondered how the heck they would get to new orleans sitting a door with a sea biscuit under it pulling an inflatable crocodile behind it  there were other great scenes throughout the movie   but the part that reached out to me was the part when dexter s health started to deteriorate  you just couldn t help but wonder if he was going to make it but towards the end you find out  i thought at the first prank they played  that dexter was really dead he obviously wasn t  silly me  but when they play the third  something is very wrong  dexter doesn t get up to laugh nor does he show any kind of laughter  at that point the victim of their prank soon announces that poor dexter had died  at that part i lost it  i balled my eyes out  and from that scene onwards i was crying  you just have to  as the end nears you start to understand eric s loss and then the movie ends on a nice note with dexters shoe floating ever so slowly down the river   overall this movie was excellent  it has laughter  adventure  emotion and sadness etc  when you put that in a blender you get an excellent  must watch film  peter horton has done a great job directing this film and i believe its certainly one of his best  but for now  i will try to search for this movie on dvd  if it exists that is  once again a superb movie that will take you on an emotional rollercaoster,1,
i adore the ln chaney version of  phantom  and i appreciate webber s version if only for the growing interest in the book  wish i find more of a mystery slash horror with the romantic aspects downplayed  i don t approve of the fact that andrew lloyd webber made the relationship between raoul and christine less restrained   luckily since this is a comedic short with only erik and christine this version doesn t even have to bother with any other characters   i thought i would still be waiting for another version to match up lon s performance  i was dead wrong  leslie nielson is fabulous as erik though  of course this is a spoof  it s still brilliant   i especially appreciated the fact that erik looked more like a living corpse than an accident victim  i still have as of yet to see a phantom like that  other than lon s   however  i do not recommend this short if you don t like spoofs  because this is in no way supposed to be taken seriously,1,
i m not going to tell anyone what happens in the end  but it did not fit with the movie  the rest of imaginary heroes  though  portrayed a realistic family going through realistic issues  such as death  drugs  relationships  and high school  i could have sworn that they were my own family  no joke   emile hirsch was completely believable as a teen struggling with his brother s suicide  and sigourney weaver plays a mother trying to keep the remains of her  slightly  dysfunctional family together   although this family may take their issues to the extreme  anyone can relate to what they go through  whether it be graduation  living up to expectations  or being a parent,1,
i m afraid i must disagree with mr  radcliffe  as although he is correct in saying this isn t a comedy  it has many other merits  the plot is a little mad at parts  but i believe it it all fits together nicely  creating a satisfying  enjoyable film  the last scene was rather abysmal compared to the rest of the film  but the actual ending of the plot a few scenes previously is very interesting  showing just what someone will do under stressful circumstances   i would recommend this film to fans of thrillers and action movies  but if you re a fan of gangster movies then as long as you don t expect expect something as deep as goodfellas then you should still find it enjoyable,1,
it is hard to believe that anyone could take such a great book and and make such a terrible movie   imagine king kong being recast as an organ grinder s monkey and fay wray s part being played by a young boy  how about elton john as rambo     this movie is even worse than the tv remake of the night of the hunter   by using the title watchers and dean koontz s name the makers of this movie should be sued for fraud by readers of the book who expected a reasonably accurate adaptation of the book   read the book  i have never talked to anyone who didn t like it  another good book is the winner by david baldachi,0,
wonderful songs  sprightly animation and authentic live action make this a classic adaptation of a classic tale  a nice british feel which sets it apart and above from the standard  saccharine sweet disney cartoons,1,
born bad is a well put together crime drama about a group of teenage kids  teens as well as young adults would find this movie well acted and entertaining  the movie is similar to the black circle boys in the sense that a bunch of teenage boys go around their town making up their own rules and not caring about the consequences,1,
oh  god  why didn t you give this money for charity  i thought i saw the lowest crap by now  but i was wrong  who did this script  anyway  a retarded  who did this cast  i can t believe that there are people that spend money and time to do garbage like that  i was under the impression that i m watching a porn movie  only without sex scenes  that bad was the so called acting  onestly  did this film have a director  i believe not and i m convince that everybody had upon them a page with some lines and red it in front of the camera  i can t explain myself how all the characters in this garbage died without a fight  nobody can do lower than this  please  erase it even from imdb  bleah,0,
i loved catcher in the rye  it happens to be my favorite book  jd salinger  the author of catcher  has the rights to the book and made it so not one person can make a movie about it with his permission   with that said  heres  united states of leland   beautiful movie with much meaning and depth in emotion  but a lot of it reminded me of catcher  almost too much reminded me of catcher  the few stories that leland told in the movie such as visiting new york and his adventures were very similar to those of holden s in catcher  and the way leland views people and emotions is also similar to holden s  they both are simple and true to themselves and others  superior acting credited to don cheadle and kevin spacy  great editing  all falls together perfectly  and loved the story all together  recommend as a buy or at least a rent  good movie   the only thing that it does drag at some points but makes up for it in the long run  give it time and appreciate a good movie,1,
its a feel good movie that made me feel good  some in this genre can be sickly sweet  but this script is restrained  the movie is funny and fun  the acting is great   if this were a musical  i would have left the theater humming the tunes,1,
focus is an engaging story told in urban  wwii era setting  william macy portrays everyman who is taken out of his personal circumstances and challenged with decisions testing his values affecting the community  laura dern  macy and david paymer give good performances  so also the good supporting ensemble,1,
i am new at this  so bear with me please  i am a big fan of surface  i thought the script and the computer graphics were exceptional  as good as any sci fi flick i ve seen at the theater  in february the tv guide said season finale  the announcer for the show said something to the effect of      and now for the season finale of surface   season finale  not series finale  i couldn t wait for fall to get here  to see was going to happen next  so fall gets here and it s nowhere to be found  if nbc isn t going to pick it up  what about sci fi or usa  it seems to me that bay watch didn t last long on abc   then usa picked it up  and it went gang busters   i bet abc was chocking  ha  if not a series  then at least a mini series  to give all us loyal fans closure  what happened to our guy s trapped in the church steeple  was the creature in the chaple nim  did he have a grouth spert  does the cloned guy come over to our side  there are so many unanswered questions  thank s for listening to me babble,1,
big fat liar is the best movie ever  it is funny  and cool  jason shepherd  frankie muniz  proves that he was not lying and goes to los angeles to get his paper back from marty wolf  paul giamatti   along with friend kaylee amanda bynes   mess up his life since marty won t call jasons  dad and say he wrote the paper  yet it all turns out good and is a good movie to watch,1,
a holiday on a boat  a married couple  an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason to this films beginning   i like boobs  no question about that  but when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment  mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim  my anger just rises to a whole new level  take two guys  a husband and another man   put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them  ad a deserted island  subtract all her moral issues  ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments  fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this    the acting is  i would say  good  there are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see  the main female character makes me sick  this is due to her lack of moral values  the man with the most fish get s her attention  even though one of them is her husband  she sees no problem with being unfaithful with  manuel  the other man because  i must do it to survive   how can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is   feet away  and he won t even benefit from it  the female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does  if she doesen t get approval for her actions  she s a victim   i recommend everyone to see this movie  this is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience,0,
the war at home is a splendid television series and i don t understand because she has been annulled  please fairies something to continue with this very beautiful television series  with excellent and marvelous actors  good recitation and good situations  please we want the third series and even so many new episodes  i pray you     i would like if possible somehow to make to reach this and mail the interested forehand  since i can tell you that here in italy this series is very liked  as in other countries of europe chest of drawers for example spain  in effects as i have written above what strikes of this television series it is the good recitation of the actors and also the honest one with which numerous matters of true importance are treated  i think both one of the best american television series arrive on the italian screens in these last years i pray you,1,
you know  before seeing this film i had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases  i mean if they were arrested and charged   they must have been guilty  i reasoned   i formed this opinion over some years  you see a good friend of mine once worked as a detective in some of the more seedy areas of sydney  he frequently complained that his policing efforts were wasted due to  bleeding heart  lawyers and magistrates  he would  bang the crooks up in the morning and they would be  back on the street by noon   it took its toll    they wore him down  he quit   he has argued since  not unreasonably i thought  that creative evidence gathering  to keep the baddies  where they belong   was    well     acceptable     my arguments about the rights of innocent people weren t valid he claimed   what are the chances that you will ever be arrested and charged with a serious crime   he would argue  and  being a law abiding citizen  the weight of his argument convinced me he was right  the chances of me  or any of my family or friends  being charged with murder or a serious offense were zero to none i thought    hmmmmm  well as mentioned earlier  seeing this wonderfully enlightening documentary changed all that    i m sending him a copy,1,
so good  the acting  cutting  directing in there may not be the best ever  but the dancing  the moves  the heat and the passion in this movie is definitely the best  well   atleast for me     it really touched me  inspired me to learn dancing  i even especially registered to this site just so i could vote on it and contribute my support for this movie  for this movie  it literally gave me goosebumps when i watched it  i love it  jennifer grey is so pretty  patrick is so sexy in there                    the first thing i ll do tomorrow  on my way to university will be to drop by the video store n buy a copy of it  n watch it again n again till i am old n wrinkly n cant dance with the movie any longer  before than i need to learn all the dance moves there,1,
this film  had it been done properly  has so much potential  parody films are always funny  and people tend to like them because they re light hearted  stupid and silly but fun  this film was funny in some parts  but it could have been a lot funnier  the acting itself was ok from all the actors  but   i wasn t satisfied  it seemed a tad empty  and my summary title says it all about the effects  proper green screens weren t used for this movie   backgrounds were added in after which just looked terrible  no wonder this film went straight to dvd lol  it wasn t all a total loss  it is funny and will give you a good laugh  at it  not with it most of the time,0,
this is one of those films that  for whatever reason  just clicked with me  everything about it is right  eric roberts laconic  nice investigator  his voiceover narration  the twisting plot  dan hedaya and denis lipscomb given good roles  the settings  the paintings in the artist studio scenes  the end credit sequence and the wonderfully haunting theme music that perfectly encapsulates the mood of the whole film  if i have any reservations it is about beverly d angelo as the femme fatale  but she plays her final scenes beautifully  i think that director matthew chapman was trying for a sort of  chinatown  feel to the whole thing  it didnt work  but as a murder mystery its a gem,1,
don t let the rating of      as of this writing on          fool you  this is one excellent film   i cannot fathom how this got such a rating considering being so solid at all levels  the direction  acting  cinematography  all good  the story is interesting and original and my only inkling as far as understanding why the rating is such  sits in the fact that it is probably the type of movie that people rating might not normally see   i equate it to playing modern rock for an    year old  you might be young  brought up on it and love it  but he or she has not been and as a product of a different time and taste  doesn t care for it   if you like films and can handle movies based more on real people versus those comprised of mindless action  enormous flashy budgets and mediocre talent  give this one a try next time you see it on,1,
okay  so i m a sucker for a good documentary  particularly where it tells a modern day don quixote story  a caveat  i met mark borchardt in the winter of         while he was still working on coven  but i ll save that story for later  american movie  which commenced production not long after  accurately portrays the person that i knew  although in greater depth than i expected or believed existed  this is simultaneously a very funny and very sad film  and is brilliantly executed  mark comes across as his own worse enemy  his childlike ambition and optimism    which i admire    is undermined by his apparent artistic ineptitude as well as his bizarre fiscal expectations  but he s also a charismatic guy  his loyal sancho panza sidekick is equally likeable  loyal  if frazzled  to the core  like don quixote  american movie presents an often ignored inefficient aspect of freedom    that people will be drawn toward professions to which they are not particularly well suited  irrespective of repeated failure  it is a great film,1,
there is no denying that this is a bad movie  the acting isn t great  likewise the script  acting and direction  still  i cannot wait until its         video release from anchor bay  everyone knows there are several bad movies out there that have a tremendous appeal to them  this one tops my list,1,
the stepford children is the second best stepford movie in the stepford series i saw the original the stepford wives in the theater when it came out in      i was absolutely blown away it was terrific i have seen all of the stepford movies  and i like all of them i think that the stepford children is such a campy and fun movie i just watched it again recently on tape  and i enjoyed it immensely the cast in this movie was real good to watch  barbara eden did a bang up job as usual every role that she has ever played has been very good barbara eden is very good at playing roles where she is a kind and nurturing type of person don murray as the husband and father was just perfect in this movie he was particularly effective at being the irritated father to his two teenage children i made sure that i have all of the stepford movie on tape to enjoy if you get a chance to see this movie you should,1,
i can t believe how dumb this movie truly is  the storyline  written by keira knightley s mother  is what ruins the movie to the extreme  it is straight out dull  absurd  and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever     this movie lagged so bad for most of it  especially at the beginning  the story just kept going on and on about their everyday flirts with each other  often times seeming like a threesome  in this movie  you have an annoying deadbeat couple  the poet and his wife  who are complete total drunks from the start  the wife sleeps around with other men to make ends meet  while the poet is a pervert who thrives on cheap boos and women  the wife  who waaayyyyyy too quickly becomes friends with his former childhood lover  played by keira  suddenly gets jealous  knowing full well that the two were lovers since they were kids  something doesn t seem right here    i mean  come on    get with the program lady  what d you expect   bottom line is  former lovers meet again with new wife embracing it  then gets jealous  then former woman lover gets married and her husband gets jealous  bombards the crazy drunk couple s home  crazy husband calls police  and they end up going to court for the man s attempted murder charges  that s it summed up in a nutshell     this movie had it s moments such as the quality and good acting by cillian murphy  but other than that  i cannot believe i watched it    i complained about it during the movie and some family members watching it with me fell asleep  i decided to give it a chance and i should have stuck to my first instincts,0,
i was permanently scarred by this terrible film   the main action of the movie is nothing special  it seems there s a tribe of snake worshipping people in a remote mountain region of northern china  where women rather than men are the leaders and decision makers  i suppose among some men  this is enough to make  succubare  a horror movie    anyway  occasionally chinese men would wander into the village  take a fancy to the local girls  seduce them and then abandon them  unfortunately for the men  the women had put them under a spell  derived from snake venom  which would make them die horribly in     days    their bellies swollen like a pregnant woman s with live worms and snakes    if they did not return   forget the cover of the us video  this has nothing to do with vampires  though there is one inept blood drinking scene  the title itself is only marginally appropriate   succubare  is the latin verb meaning  to lie beneath   and it s the root of the word succubus  a female demon who would seduce men in their sleep  actually  it s the men who are the seducers here   but it s not the main action of this ludicrous film that s so objectionable  it s the little side incidents  i ll overlook the slaughter and butchery of an ox that s performed on screen  the participants seem very experienced  as though this is an unpleasant duty they actually do in real life  and i m sure they really ate the animal afterwards    though i resent having the act thrust in my face as  entertainment    what i wish i could overlook  or had overlooked  are the numerous  totally extraneous shots of an unidentified man  who from time to time interrupts the story by eating living animals  he starts the movie by tearing apart a live snake with his teeth  in the course of the movie  he devours a bug  a lizard  a toad  i had to leave the room after this   and a whole mouse  i stopped watching at this point  and lost my appetite for days   let me stress that this was totally unexpected  and had nothing to do with the movie    unless it s a cynical reference to love as it s portrayed in the film  a blind  selfish  predatory survival mechanism that tears apart the helpless    but then again  i m probably just rationalizing to get the vileness out of my head,0,
i really liked this movie  it totally reminds me of my high school days  the soundtrack is awesome  i am a huge nic cage fan and this is my favorite movie that he is in  i love the storyline  it is a total love story  against the odds kind of thing  i think anyone who graduated in the early eighties             should see the movie  it totally brought back memories of high school for me,1,
the plot of  open graves  is very simple it s about a board game called mamba where the players die in real life the same way they die in the game laughable death scenes include killings via computer generated crabs and snakes the characters are cardboard and deliberately annoying and there isn t even a tiny bit of suspense i liked eliza dushku in  wrong turn  but she is completely wasted and unmemorable here the climax with cgi witch coming from the sea is utterly laughable and stupid the only reason to see  open graves  are some interesting camera angles plus sexy eliza dushku if such movies are the future of horror then i seriously give up give me any    s or    s low budget horror flick over this modern piece of crap a generous   out of,0,
spending an hour seeing this brilliant dan finnerty and his  dan band  perform their special on bravo is the most enjoyable hour i ve ever spent watching tv  this young man  dan  is such an incredible talent  as a singer  performer and even dancer  he can go from the cheesiest of ballad pop songs  all of which have only been sung by women  to hip hop  rock  also songs written for women   this guy can do anything  i ve seen him live at least    times  so i was not expecting just how well that his show would adapt to a television or film format  but all reservations went away instantly when the show started because of dan s overwhelming star quality do yourself a favor and watch this  or better yet  buy it,1,
this is a perfect movie to watch with a loved one on a cold and snowy night  if you like a few laughs with your horror then this is the movie for you  the makings of a real cult classic  it has everything you would want to see in a horror movie  a beautiful girl  a hero  the buffoon  a monster truck and of course a family of mutant satanic killers  this one is full of blood guts and gore  i strongly recommend watching this one in the wee early morning hours  and be careful of who sees you being entertained by the sounds of monster trucks  bad  but funny   one liners and our hero eating eye ball stew  not as good as the evil dead but a close second  just remember warning      do not eat before viewing this film,1,
now this is the sort of film we used to get weekly   now a days it is rare to see a drama that depends on the cast talking to each other   there are no explosions  car chases or any chases there are implied sexual situations this is not film for the younger crowd  it is for those that appreciate people talking to each other they do argue a lot as we have married couple having mid life problems   emily watson   tom wilkinson are seemingly a very happy middle aged loving man   wife  now living in this same small london suburb  handsome  rupert everett returns home to visit his wealthy father   he of course meets emily watson  it would be easy for anyone to be smitten by emily  i say no more  except that as the credits begin there is a fatal accident the rest of the film is about the repercussions of this accident   all the lies the various characters tell    the acting by this trio   the others is excellent   julien fellows wrote the screenplay based on a novel by nigel balchin  he also directed  this was his first directorial attempt   he did very well  the entire production is first rate   the film had a few month theatrical run in late       is under    theatres  this to me is a shame  stupid comedies open on at least      screens but real good drams as this   many others open in only a few   by the way there are some very funny lines regarding certain situations   ratings          out of       points  out of      imdb    out of,1,
oh man   this movie is amazing  it s very good it s a story about a man who isn t so accepting of black people  he sits at a bar drinks on his night out and he rants about hippies who are anti war   and how blacks and hippies don t deserve to get any welfare checks  this movie is very realistic  because it portrays a guy  joe  who represented a lot of guys back then  and now too  the story goes like this     joe is in a bar and he rubs shoulders with a rich guy who just accidentally killed his daughter s hippie boyfriend  and this rich goes to the bar to rethink what he just did  and while he s doing that   joe  is in the bar ranting about hippies and people who are against the war  the rich guy accidentally tells joe that he killed a hippie   and obviously joe applauds the rich guy  cause joe hates hippies  amazing movie watch it to see what happens next  i liked this movie   because it was reminiscent of those days in the early    s  i liked the way movies were shot back then in those days  very good stuff   it s not like today s movies  basically the movie gives you an inner look into the mind of the lead character  joe    i like the theme of the movie         about the working man   who s busting his ass trying to make a living,1,
i don t think i have ever seen a better movie parody  mel brooks is insane  every time i watch it i find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before  cary elwes is perfect for the role of robin hood  it has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up  every character is great from little john and will to maid marian and broomhilde  i laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it  watch it    if you liked cary elwes in this movie  you must definitely see the princess bride,1,
an evil spirit takes over a girl and diffuses panic in the louvre museum that s all i think  the summary of the movie and the movie itself   which i think it s one of the worst french or non french movies ever made in the history of cinema     nothing good in here except the music  of the credits only     some tender moments of  sophie marceau   and of course the movie s finale shot   not because it ends ages of what seemed to be a countless years we had in watching that crap but also for being so perfect as one magical c g i work that was too good to be true in here     by the way i want to change the plot summary to be like this  an evil spirit takes over some cinema artists to make lousy movies    just like this one for sure,0,
i am so angry to the point i normally down make reviews with spoilers but in this case i ll make an exception the first scenes of this movies are weak and then when they get to the meat and potatoes of the movie it sucks  this is one movie were i rooted for the bad guys because the captain save the day was unbelievable and there was no connection to him or nothing to make you like him  the lead actor gave the weakest performance and laurence fishburne or matt dillon couldn t even save this movie  sometime there are eye openers or great moments in a film that may not be that great  this movie has none  if you are looking for a movie to see in the meantime while nothing peeked your interest   don t choose this one  save your money,0,
while mind of mencia could be summed up as nothing more than a clone of chappelle s show  it is really worse than that  first of all  carlos mencia is a jacka   that is as funny as he is original  which isn t saying much  the show contains lame spoofs of american television ads and political issues  and mencia s  comedic  insight on politics adds to the low quality of this show  on top of it all  mencia tosses in more lame ethnic jokes and stolen jeff foxworthy lines than i can count on one hand  while every once in a while carlos gets a cheap laugh  the rest of the time he spends insulting everyone in sight  which does include exploiting his own audience members  with the exception of south park  drawn together  and friday night stand up  this show marks the end of the chappelle s show glory days  which for those of you who haven t heard  was before he went to africa,0,
following up the     s classic horror film carrie with this offering  is like ford following the mustang with the edsel  this film was horrendous in every detail  it would have been titled beverly hill       meets mystery science theater       but both of those shows far exceed this tripe  this film was scarcely a horror film  i timed about   minutes of gore and    minutes of lame high school hazing and ritual  wow  what a surprise  carrie s weird friend commits suicide  wow  carrie misconstrues her love interests affections  wow  the in crowd sets up carrie  wow  the jocks have a sexual scoring contest  what this film needed was way more action and far less tired teen cliches  this film is totally unviewable,0,
this film is one of the best of      with creepy  yet intriguing performances from crispin glover and dennis hopper  the reagan years were pretty bleak for a lot of people  not just teenagers  but this flick really captured the desperation and despair  well directed with great script  apparently based on a true story   i don t really see any weaknesses in this  the opening shot was brilliant   keanu reeves was decent for a change and miss skye was right on the money  hopper had three other great performances that same year  blue velvet  texas chainsaw ii  and hoosiers   i imagine this has a cult following and i wonder how this picture would fare if it was re released  super stuff,1,
i saw this film at the boston internation festival of women s cinema last night  and was saddened to hear ms  troche tell us  in her q a after the screening  that she doesn t expect to see too much us distribution  due to her insistence on including all of the so called  gay content   it was a fantastically entertaining comedy  and it just seems to me that american audiences might enjoy it in much the same way they enjoyed  the full monty   so it s really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots of two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters  wonderful cast  fabulous script  and of course  rose troche s direction make this one of the funniest films i ve seen,1,
i remember seeing this film in my late teens or early twenties on tv   probably hbo  i watched it with my parents  a brother and a few friends  since that was about    years ago  i don t remember a lot of the story  i do remember that the entire group of us watching agreed that this was the funniest movie we had ever seen  when it was over  our bellies hurt from so much laughing  my dad worked at a hospital  so that made it all the better   every time i see the party in the tv listings  i look to see if this one is there  too  to my dismay  it never is  although i loved the party  i feel this one is funnier  peter sellers was great as a crooked hospital administrator  why it s never been released on video is a mystery to me  it s a classic  but it appears that nobody under    or    has been allowed to see it  i d buy it in a second if they ever release it to dvd,1,
i don t believe it    luc besson is not only a genius now   he has always been one    this film is for everyone who likes real good deep films   just perfect,1,
most of this political thriller presented as a mostly run of the mill movie with a somewhat better development of many of the major characters  that was much appreciated  until the big twist and powerful climax that recalled twists experienced in  silence of the lambs   or  the sixth sense   reese witherspoon as the distraught wife of the missing egyptian husband and yigal naor as the strong armed interrogator offer strong performances  jake gyllenhaal unfortunately is handed a more two dimensional character and has to struggled with a stereotypical presentation of the emotionally torn cia analyst that has been presented many times before in other movies  early on there is the nice scene with an explosion that resembles a scene at the end of  saving private ryan   the silent scene that was used so effectively in reflecting one consequence of violence  the script also provides a little more glimpse into the mind set of the  enemy  but still doesn t allow the audience really much understanding  again permitting the audience to wallow in stereotypical characterization  the cinematography and photography also is somewhat of a letdown because unlike  jarhead   or  blackhawk down   the crisp  raw visceral presentation is missing not allowing the audience to really be there in the movie  there is some distance that keeps the audience from realizing the intensity of the emotions occurring on the screen  however  overall  the movie redeems itself by the end  offering the audience a measured look into the complexity of the united states  use of rendition and the possible complications and consequences that may occur through its use  eight out of ten stars,1,
there are so many episodes that make me howl over the stories  that i wish i could pick the best ones   rocko and bill make for a strange pair that are beyond help but manage to play the victim and bs their way out of hard time just to drag dan into their life of crime    canadians will notice the odd joke for toronto or the federal government  and because the cbc axed a really good show by the frantics that dan was part of   the show takes shots at them and in the episode  dan s umbrella  the cbc is raked across the coals    when dan says that the cbc would never waste taxpayers money on useless venture   rocko enters the room and gives dan back his tape of friday night with ralph benmurgue   this show was a flop and most people wouldn t get the joke unless they knew the cbc s history for making shows people don t watch or axing good shows that they do watch,1,
this is the worst film i ve seen in a long long time  never mind the fact that so many useful things keep appearing on this island  how convenient       the acting is beyond poor from the outset  its like one of those really badly scripted soft porn films on channel    a complete waste of time  and i cant remember the lead actors name but i cant believe he still gets work    i ve never seen him act  i ve seen him in lots of films    but i ve never seen him act  here are a few of the blaringly obvious errors  apparently petrol lighters still work even when they ve been soaked in sea water    also according to this film you can walk into the sea naked but come out wearing bikini bottoms  i m guessing the camera man and editor were students there are plenty more errors but i m ranting now  besides its no so much the errors as the cast the script and the whole film avoid at all costs,0,
if you re a long time fan of the doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series  rest easy    it more than meets the high expectations of the original  the pacing is much quicker than the original shows  fitting more often into    minutes episodes rather than the average    minutes  the writing is excellent  the acting superb  the hardest   and best   thing to get used to is the production values of the new series  compared to the original  it s got some now   although i will always have fond memories of bubble wrap and hand puppet monsters   if you re not a fan  or if you tried the original and couldn t get a handle on it  jump in with both feet now  everything you really need to know about the doctor  they ll tell you as they go along  this series was written with minimal references to the doctor s enormous back story specifically to encourage new viewers  admittedly  i m only seeing the first new series now as it s being shown on the sci fi channel  in other words  probably cut to ribbons for time constraints   but i m looking forward to future episodes either on broadcast tv or on dvd   july  th can t come soon enough,1,
this is hands down the most annoying and frustrating game i have ever encountered  every time you turn around the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you can t walk through  the cut scenes leave you in control of your character s movements  but only to a slight degree  also  you have to play the game for about   hours just to get past the intro tutorials  it s terrible  i am afraid if i play this game any more i will end up breaking something  this game sucks  the graphics are good  but nothing special  the game play  however  is awful  to say i hate this game would be a huge understatement  i got it on sale  but i want my     back  what a waste,0,
this movie strayed too far from straub s novel for me to enjoy  barely made it to the middle of the film  besides changing don wanderly from edwards nephew into his son  the removed most of the major scenes and a number of characters that gave the novel so much life  what was left was trash  straub s version was far superior to this poorly executed film  i don t think casting did all that great a job on picking the chowder society members either  hopefully someone will come along and actually remake this film correctly in my lifetime  i just hate when hollywood butchers the works of talented authors because they think their version so much better  makes me sick,0,
words cannot express how poor this film is   there is no plot  the acting is appalling  basically the whole film is a joke   with a running time of    minutes  it s about    minutes too long   it might have been ok as a short sketch on a comedy show  but the premise is way too flimsy to work for that amount of time without boredom kicking in   avoid this one  go rent a good movie instead,0,
this production was quite good  the usual fabulous scenery  interesting  quirky characters  it was just so strange not to have captain hastings  miss lemon  and poirot s office residence  so prominently featured in the original pbs bbc mysteries   in the original series  so much took place at the office  hastings reading the paper  while poirot  exercises his little gray cells   miss lemon pitching in whenever needed   poirot without capt  hastings would be like holmes without watson     he can most certainly solve the crime  but it is not as interesting   and what would a poirot mystery be without hastings  with his impeccable manners  falling for some beautiful  unattainable woman,1,
bad  ambient sound  lots of shuffling  loooong pointless scenes  eg  guy sees interesting woman in lobby  manages to stay there and watch her under the guise of waiting for the building supervisor to get a package  says nothing  stares creepily  more shuffling and other irritating ambient noise  wait  wait  wait  guy says nothing  woman looks frightened or at least slightly disturbed about it and rightly so  manager comes back with package  guy goes up to the apartment with the package   another example  the guy and his host sit around watching bad tv  more ambient noise and shuffling  wait wait wait wait  guy wanders off to bed  if you can stand to sit through any more of this movie  you get to watch them watch tv again later   if you want a story  any dialogue  entertainment  or a well crafted film  look elsewhere,0,
death promise is a lost    s exploitation gem and deserves to be seen  technically somewhat of a mess and boasting a stock of amateur new yawk types  this film never bores  i highly recommend tracking this down  it s a hoot and a half,1,
i sell the dead              dominic monaghan  larry fessenden  ron perlman  angus scrimm  john speredakos  eileen colgan  brenda cooney  uneven blend of horror and comedy that poses as a valentine to the    s horror films by roger corman and hammer studios  with two cretinous grave robbers  monaghan and fessenden  facing final punishments for the crimes via the guillotine but not before their tales of the occult can be recalled in flashbacks  amusing and a few well sprinkled jolts but really a mess of a b movie trying in vein to be a cult classic largely thanks to the casting of genre vets perlman and scrimm to no avail  a good rental for halloween   dir  glenn mcquaid,1,
this film was brilliant  i absolutely loved it  wesley snipes was great for this role   and i m sure blade   would be just as good   blade is by far one of my favorite action horror movies out there  and if you havent seen it yet  and like vampires and blood  all that stuff  you should really rent it  because i assure you that you ll love it,1,
this is a good enough movie and you probably won t be disappointed  but it again has roy scheider  right after he did  french connection   playing a cop with the name  buddy   they also use the same too memorable wheelman from  bullitt   at first you ll think you ve seen the car chase before if you have his face still in your memory  the car chase is a great one  but as in many car movie scenes  it has some technical and editing errors  check  puppet on a chain  and  french connection ii  for some other good  long  intense chases,1,
a powerful debut film from murali k  thalluri that explores events in the life of a group of high school students  each of them in crisis in one way or another  the film starts with the discovery of the body of one of the students  then traces the lives of the group over the previous hours  leaving the audience in suspense until the last minutes as to the identity of the deceased  each of the main characters is facing major stressors which we could see as potentially precipitating a suicide  the cast of unknowns provide performances full of power and emotion  fantastically well done  especially considering the youth of the writer director who was    years old when he wrote the script,1,
if you were ever a fan of mtv s  the state   then these three guys will be familiar to you  but even if you only stumbled upon them via the internet like i did  you will soon come to appreciate their unique brand of comedy   born out of their stand up comedy trio   stella   michael ian black  michael showalter and david wain produced these brilliant vignettes of surreal comedy to display at their shows  and now after being available only to download from two websites  they appear in pristine glory on one dvd   think comedy sketch show sans censorship  and you d be halfway there  no stone of decency is left unturned  but for those who like their comedy rude  self indulgent and bordering on puerile   and i mean that in the most flattering way  this is the dvd for you   i think it s worth the money for the commentary from the two michaels and david alone  you can t help but take a liking to them as they explain their actions  cringe at their own antics with sex toys and by turn pat each other on the back and hurl abuse   fantastic   it must say something for the appeal of stella that the likes of julie bowen and paul rudd are willing to throw themselves into the action so fearlessly  and you should follow their fine example  throw preconceptions to the wind  and prepare to laugh yourself sick,1,
beyond rangoon is one of the most emotional and intense films ever made  superbly directed by john boorman  and intensly acted by patricia arquette  this film can easily be called one of the best films of the    s  the story and vivid characters just grab the audience from the very opening  and never lets go  after seeing the film  the viewer will never be able to forget  beyond rangoon   the film made little money at the box office  and is little known  but should be high profile  watching it  you can tell that it was meant to be seen by a large audience  it is a very important and moving film  and should be seen by everyone,1,
women will like this movie better than men  of course  women like all romantic comedies more than men   on average  i generally like romantic comedies quite a bit  however i considered this a     for the first     of the movie and about a     for the next     and about a   for the last      so  begrudgingly  i will rate it a    i tape and keep all movies rated a   or better and none that are a   or worse   at least that s my objective  i have over      movies  so why keep the dogs   my wife liked this movie quite a bit more than me  though i m not sure why  i am a bigger drew barrymore fan than she is   the whole point of this movie was about a young woman who goes back to high school  undercover  to write a story about the high school experience nowadays  she was a dork in high school the first time around and has to learn how to be cool the second time around  her journey toward cooldom  as well as her falling in love with a teacher  is the story   what drove me nuts for the first half the movie was just how mangy she looked  i wondered why they would pick her for this role until i realized how capable she is at looking like a dog  so much so that i truly don t think i want to see her in    years when she gets up in the morning  argh  naturally  she transformed into a rather attractive  cute  woman by the end and she became very popular   the ending is about a     on the very sweet scale  so you sappers out there will like that  otherwise  it isn t very memorable and easily missable,1,
i first saw this movie back in      or     during my freshman year in high school when it was on lifetime  after i first saw it  i thought it was wonderful  sure  it may not have run longer  but it is as accurate as can be in my own opinion  regardless of what anyone else may think   cynthia gibb was great at portraying karen  and mitchell anderson was okay as richard  louise fletcher  yes  who played nurse ratched in      s  one flew over the cuckoo s nest   was fine as well  but i found her version of agnes  karen and richard s mother  to be a little bit of a control freak  i am an extremely huge fan of the carpenters  and i believe that karen s voice was and still is so wonderful  it really saddens me about the fact that she is gone and had left this earth too soon  but thanks to the never ending popularity of her music and her angelic voice  the music will live on  anyway  back on track to this movie  it really is a mystery to me and possibly other people  fans and non fans of the carpenters  as to what caused karen to end up getting this problem with her health  was it the media that was responsible or was it just karen s decision  i would not believe that it was her decision  it could have been the media from one article that was printed out about her somewhere in      when their hit  close to you  came out  from what was shown in the film   there are some other moments in the movie as well  richard s struggle with drugs  and karen s brief marriage  i did not hear about her loss in february of       as i was not yet into watching the news  i had found out years later  i don t know if there will be another movie about the carpenters or karen made in the future  but until then  this movie will do fine  i will say this though  if karen had disregarded the false details of that article or any future articles that might have been published with similar content calling her  chubby   which must have been quite an insult   she would still be here on this earth today  i know that she is in heaven and probably entertaining everyone with her beautiful voice  god bless you  karen,1,
todd sheets has created one of the greatest low budget zombie movies ever  the story is great  the gore is grand  the psychos are wicked  yet the movie is flawed by its petty dialogue and sluggish imaging at times   despite this zb  delivers what any zombie movie should  gore  good plot  fast pace adventure into the macarbe  if only mr sheets had been given a    k budget this movie would out do every zombie movie ever even the almighty dawn of the dead   but as time goes by he gets better and as he gets better more money comes into his pocket  thus allowing this man this modern day genius to craft his vision better   just remember that zombie bloodbath   was just one of his great stepping stones when he is atop of gore mountain,1,
i took my younger niece to an early showing and she loved it  i enjoyed it myself as well   i don t need to explain the plot  since the movie remains completely true to the award winning  top selling book by famed author carl hiaasen  the movie takes the popular book and layers it with beautiful cinematography  i want to go to florida now    humor  thanks to funny man  luke wilson and some new comers   and great music  i have to get to get a jimmy buffet cd now  i know a movie is good when i get goose bumps in the end  overall  it was great family film that i felt comfortable taking my younger niece to  i d recommend it to any and everyone,1,
once you sit down to see this film   a cannon for cordoba   you get the feeling it s going to be a great  the reason  the film begins with a rousing score by noted composer elmer bernstein who gave us such memorable themes as  the great escape and the magnificent seven   indeed  when you read the opening credits headlining the cast is none other than george peppard as capt  rod douglas  you know it s going to have action and lot s of it  furthermore when you see actor john russel playing general john j  pershing  you know you re in for a heroic saga  the story is taken from the annals of the mexican revolution and involves the u s  in a border town dispute with the mexican bandits who cross the rio grande in the early     s  among the most brazen of the rebel leaders is general cordova  raf vallone   with his army of mexican revolutionaries  he attacks pershing  kills his men and steals some valuable artillery pieces  since the united states army cannot enter mexico legally  capt  douglas is sent on what is slated a suicide mission  without orders and without aid from pershing  his mission is to retrieve the cannons  destroy a rebel stronghold and bring cordova back alive  selecting the roughest  toughest  most experienced  certainly the most insolent men available  douglas enters mexico and attacks the nearly impregnable fortress  dramatic action follows  as does lots of explosive excitement  if one is asks for criticism  i would say the choice of heavies  vallone and john larch are not very menacing  not so with the men who side with peppard  pete duel and don gordon  who is superb   nevertheless  this movie is recommended as good viewing,1,
an obvious vanity press for julie in her first movie with blake  let s see  where do we begin  she is a traitor during a world war  she redeems that by falling in love  her friends  who are presumably patriots because they are german citizens  are expendable and must die  and she winds up as a heroine  ok  the scenes with the drunken pilot and the buffoons who work for french intelligence can t even be described  and we won t even mention rock s romantic scenes with a female   by the way  when they visit a museum  look at his gaze   i reran it on video and it s priceless   is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie  i don t know and you won t either,0,
mild spoilers       the premise goes like this   a store gets burnt down and assistant sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the wrap to which sergio agrees    so far so good   but there s a fair lapse of logic involved sergio agrees to do this for the sum of        dollars but why   come on guys if you were a good looking white boy would you run the risk of getting a long spell in a tough jail   a very real possibilty for arson   for the sake of    grand   i know i wouldn t   and seeing as you d have a criminal record no employer would want to touch you with a barge pole so is         dollars all that much for a life of workfare and welfare cheques   there s also something else that seems to have gone without notice from the premise   since mister lumpke has told sergio that his son did the fire he seems unware of the possibility that he may know too much   wouldn t alarm bells be ringing in your mind about someone wanting to keep you quite if they told you something     i guess we re not suppossed to think about such details since a pyromaniac s love story isn t suppossed to be an intelligent thriller   it s a light hearted romantic comedy  chick flick that s probably best apprieciated as a girls night in   looking through this comments page it is obvious that the movie has its defenders but as a cynical male i wasn t too impressed and william baldwin does go way over the top,0,
awful in a bad good way   this movie has officially become the worst  made for tv movie  in my book   except for the camp value it offers  i give it a   in quality and a    for the camp value  suggestion  watch with friends  champagne and plenty of popcorn   you ll want to throw some at the screen  preferably friends who like chris noth from his  sex in the city days    this movie is dreadfully funny  this is definitely the lowest point in the careers of all cast members   honestly  i don t know how they controlled the laughter as the lines were delivered  daniel j  travanti is absolutely pathetic  everyone participated in the school of over acting  and poor joan van ark  i believe she was the only one taking this theater of the absurd seriously   she is credited as a producer though  her  mom  jeans and bad plastic surgery are scene stealer s  this movie also crosses the oh so delicate line of social incorrectness when they introduce a mentally challenged character into the plot  this is an obscure movie showing on lifetime listed as  with harmful intent     has anyone else had the pleasure,0,
the plot line is an expose of the under belly of american politics  while the theme seems common  what  makes  the movie is the unconventional way the story is told   the characters are played with conviction  you feel the innocence of the lead  and his innocence lost  the politician is the prince of double talk  a real snake   the camera work is impressive  it affirms the nuances of the acting and dialogue  ditto for the music   the story uses a parable style with vingettes where the message is filled with double entendres  a very canny strategy by the writer director  the tension in the storyline is carried through to the last scenes   the movie was like a good mystery book  something was  afoot   you knew it was bad  you didn t know exactly what it could be   you had your suspicions  and when the evil was revealed you let out your breath you hadn t noticed you were holding in  saddened  shaking your head   a story well written and well told    cheers to a young writer director,1,
i watched this movie a long time ago  but i ve always loved it  the story is about a young girl  sally o moyne who finds out at a young age that when she prays to st  anne  her prayers are answered  hence her missing lunch pail and a mean neighbor who tattles on her and she prays  that someone should give him a black eye for tattling  well  a minute later something hits him and he has a black eye  sally then believes in the power of prayer and decides to use that power for good  she is well known and loved around the neighborhood as she has copybooks journals filled with all her friends requests to st  anne   meanwhile  a local boy returns home from college  i believe  and sally is awestruck at how much he s grown up  sally has a huge crush on him  but is so shy  should she use her power of prayer to st  anne for her own selfish desire or just watch as the most popular girls in school try to snare the man of her dreams  this is a fun filled movie with a grandfather who is so charming and irish  brother s who are hilariously annoying and a sworn irish neighbor enemy who spars with grand pop on an everyday basis  he has his own story of wanting to buy the o moynes property which is a little house in the middle of two huge apartment complexes  his own   in other words  the o moynes house is an eye sore to his lovely buildings   this movie is definitely worth a watch and is good enough and rare enough to add to your movie collection  i hope you enjoy,1,
may contain spoilers   clearly  who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections  i just can t see it any other way  what really surprises me is no one used the name allen smithee  and more surprising  everyone involved didn t use this name   a,0,
a man is pulled off a london street and taken to some foreign country where he is tortured as a terror suspect  dull  banal film bored the hell out of me  more an idea then a film  i was half way into this    minute film when i realized i had no idea who anyone on screen was  it was as if they took every other similar film and pulled out all of the ideas and put them in one place with out the real notion of character  certainly its well acted with passion but there is no emotional center  there is just an everyman of sorts which the filmmakers feel is enough  its not  and while the story presented id in theory important as a warning the film is too dull to convince anyone of it  especially if one has seen the other  better films of a similar ilk  rendition with reese witherspoon for example,0,
i didn t understand what that line meant    i do now  i didn t really want to see dirty dancing either  i d rented it out but never watched it   and today i did  and i thought it was a really fun  great movie that makes you want to get up and dance  alright  it was cheesy at times    but it s still a great movie  i can t believe jennifer grey was    in this movie   my friend and i thought she looked about    or         at the most  i guess this is attributed to her acting talent  and she did really look awkward at times  patrick swayze is also very good  but you can tell he is in his thirties and seems a bit old  nevertheless  still very good  i love   s songs so it really struck a chord with me  and the love story  yes  i m a romantic  was so wonderfully done  i thoroughly enjoyed this movie  exceeded my expectations,1,
this film is a variation of a theme we ve all seen over and over again   the posiedan adventure in space  the characters are all stock characters   feisty heroine  judas  coward  etc  etc  the only question really is who s next to snuff it  sometimes this tried and tested formula works   like in this case   but more often not   like the truly mind numbing  red planet     so why does this one work  because it s stylish  the acting is above average  and above all it isn t predictable  the conclusion isn t sign posted  i really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised at how it did end  that alone deserves top marks in my book   it s an intriguing and entertaining movie  and though it was never likely to change the face of cinema as we know it  it doesn t disappoint,1,
so many early british sound films that i ve seen on video suffer from either poor print transfer quality or poor sound or both  fortunately  i was able to obtain a copy of this movie on a video of excellent quality  enabling me to focus on the story itself   and  an excellent story it was  at first sight  the passengers on the ill fated bus looked like a pretty boring lot  except for the always lovely jessie matthews   but  as the film went back to show each passenger s story on the day before the accident  i discovered that the cast  contrary to initial appearance  was a talented group of performers  skillfully directed so as to bring a real individuality to their distinctive characterizations   viewers may have different preferences as to which two passengers are going to meet a tragic end and which ones will survive  but  the movie holds your interest as it keeps you guessing  this film deserves a much wider audience   a real gem of early british cinema,1,
i was told jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences  i guessed the film will be interesting in fact isn t at all  not so much profound for a such subject   eternity  never ending life  experiences after death and  dejavu   the film is not as a comedy but isn t funny at all  at least not express yet  it s so naive  charming film but naive film  a must to avoid  the middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and it s not the matter at all  eileen davidson is so charming and voight is doing his best  normal is a co producer and screenwriter of this movie  the film was launched straight on video so i discovered it on a video store  it s a pity  cause i well know voight was seriously involved with spirituality and the film isn t so much profound about it,0,
i saw this film because calexico did the score  a real disappointment  annoying  trendy scenes  with urban hipsters and their cliche hip lifestyles  cheesy stereotypical mexican border culture  mystic grandfather with the rattlesnake and potions  granddaughter in her mariachi style restaurant getup   a few laughs  but hipper than thou  and sorely lacking in vision and basic filmmaking talent,0,
i was surprised to discover michael moore or bill maher wasn t involved with this  movie   an american leftist laundry list of axes to grind  with a distinct sparseness of democrats in hell  mao zedong and karl marx didn t make an appearance in hell  but ronald reagan is in the same room with hitler  perhaps we ll have to wait for these california spin doctors to butcher paradiso for them to show all of their pet ideologue political figures   cheap shots at religion  right wing politicians  corporations and their lobbyists  fox news  even suvs  all the radical leftist talking points were too completely covered   while conspicuously omitting references to wrongdoing from the  other side of the aisle    to not have been a conscious effort  the singular exception i noticed  in the hour and a half  is jfk has to have sex with marilyn monroe for eternity  the token inclusion in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt at appearing non partisan,0,
this movie is one of the best and moving i have ever seen  because of the terrible good performance of the main actress jennifer rubin as jamie harris  who really makes you feel with her  also the music by mark snow is wonderful,1,
contains spoilers  luchino visconti s film adaptation of thomas mann s novella is visually  if not philosophically  faithful to its source  britten s opera offers a more faithful reading of the apollonian dionysian struggles which consume the aging writer   it is certainly one of the most gorgeous films ever made    in the visconti version  the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of the story  never has venice looked more beautiful and alluring  more decadent and effete  if you ve read the novella  it s like having the descriptions on its pages come to life  dirk bogarde gives an outstanding performance as gustav von aschenbach  although he has very little dialogue  he conveys the bitterness  aroused passion and finally  pitiful yearning of aschenbach through facial expressions alone  bjorn andresen  the young actor who plays tadzio  the beautiful object of aschenbach s desire  was perfectly cast  he too plays the part with facial expressions and gestures  the tadzio character is pivotal to the story  so any actor in this role must be worthy of inspiring passion and desire  visconti  with his incredible eye for beauty  knew exactly what he was doing  and changing ashenbach from a writer to a composer based on gustav mahler  and then using mahler s music  especially the adagietto from the  th symphony  was another brilliant stroke  although i d read the mann story before the film  mahler s music and death in venice will always be inextricably linked in my mind  as will the haunting images which appear throughout the film  especially that last one of ashenbach dying on the beach as tadzio walks slowly into the sea    one day this film will be released in dvd widescreen format and its visual splendors completely restored to us,1,
this was the most uninteresting horror flick i have seen to date  the premise is glaringly forgotten after about   minute  the acting is terrible  the scariest thing about this movie is when the two guys kiss  yuck  what were the film festival judges thinking when they gave this garbage a  best film  notation  the only reasons i didn t turn this movie off were to see what not to do as a filmmaker  and if the paper thin plot line could really keep going on as is was  i was not disappointed by this latter notion  there wasn t even a single bit of nudity or gore to keep the kiddies interested  also  i thought it was tacky to use about   minutes of  resident evil    in the movie    was that supposed to be filler   cause it was the goriest and most interesting part of the movie,0,
this is a very amazing movie  the characters seemed so realistic to me  it was hard to believe they weren t real people  being from the south  i thought judith ivey s character seemed especially real  and as everyone else has mentioned  she does an outstanding acting job  the characters are not beautiful and look nothing like the average hollywood stars   their imperfect bodies and personalities seem so much more natural and real    one reviewer mentioned that the main character  alice  had no good reason to run away from home  which is true   she didn t have any moral or upstanding reason to run away  such as escaping child abuse  etc  i thought that she was just fed up with dead end jobs in a working class life and wanted to flee down to florida where her friend lived the appealing and privileged life of a college student in miami  the actress shows alice s confusion  uncertainty  and questioning turn into decisiveness and willingness to take control of her life with impressive naturalness  the film also shows how alice is trapped in situations with seemingly no options  causing her to panic  take action  and reach out for help    at first  the grainy filming style put me off and made me think that it was a very low budget or homemade movie  but in actuality it is very well done  the home movie quality really makes you feel like you are there with the characters  a part of their rv trip across the country  this is definitely a film worth seeing  although i don t quite understand all the descriptions of it as a heart warming coming of age tale  it is rather vulgar and disturbing at times  even if it is not completely sad in the end,1,
tourist trap is an odd thriller that came out in the    s  it s about   friends molly  jocelyn jones   jerry  jon van hess   eileen  robin sherwood   becky  tanya roberts  and woody  kevin mcdermott   who stumble upon a cloesd down museum slausen s lost oasis  a curious and eerie roadside museum  this goldmine of decaying  but strangely life like mannequins is run by slausen  chuck conners   an eccentric  but seemingly harmless has been  slausen has one warning for the youngsters  stay away from davey  slausen s reclusive and disturbed brother   the youngsters  curiosity gets the best of them and they go exploring  the trap is sprung  amidst flying objects  slamming doors  scarves that strangle on their own  empowered by some hidden force  the trap slowly closes in on the group  the  creature  davey and his army of murderous mannequins make quick and brutal work of the friends  until only one remains   although not a slasher movie  tourist trap  still contains elements of slasher movies such as the chase scenes and the stalking and the fact the killer wears a mask   the seemingly telekinetic abilities of the killer to lock bolts and animate the wax dummies  is used to great effect  perhaps the scariest thing about this movie are the mannequins  which are admittedly scary enough to start off with  but are rally spooky here  the film succeeds despite  or perhaps because of  an obviously meagre budget  these wax figures are blatantly plastic shop dummies  but this only goes to serve as even more eerie when their eyes move with an incredible human the acting is actually pretty good  chuck conners gives a well rounded and creepy performance as mr slausen  jocelyn jones is great as the female lead,1,
i think purvis starts out to do a gay  gone with the wind  if so  sorry  tag  it didn t happen  it also didn t happen as a gay  sexploitation  flick  i guess i m confused  what are we trying to do here  much as i d like to  i simply can t get to where i care even a little about these characters  this movie is effective in capturing a taste of the decadence that lives in the south  it does nothing to explain  enlighten or advance my understanding of a gay relationship  or the conflict the protagonist seems to be grappling with,0,
for once a story of hope highlighted over the tragic reality our youth face  favela rising draws one into a scary  unsafe and unfair world and shows through beautiful color and moving music how one man and his dedicated friends choose not to accept that world and change it through action and art  an entertaining  interesting  emotional  aesthetically beautiful film  i showed this film to numerous high school students as well who all live in neighborhoods with poverty and and gun violence and they were enamored with anderson  the protagonist  i recommend this film to all ages over     due to subtitles and some images of death  from all backgrounds,1,
i found code    very disappointing  i thought the concept was good and therefore had great potential as a movie but found that it didn t deliver  code    lacked thought and structure and the storyline didn t flow well  i thought that tim robbins character wasn t well developed  for eg  i thought there should have been more info and thought put into his family life and not have it completely ignored as i felt it was  when they were first in violation of a code    it was suggested that they were not to know that they may have been genetically linked but all the technology was available to them  he took her fingerprint and therefore genetic details when he was investigating the fraud  i constantly found myself waiting for something to happen and the story line to develop and yet it never did  i felt that the film had great potential to be intellectually stimulating but turned out to be the opposite  code    tried to be too clever and in the end just ended up lacking imagination i would not recommend this film to anybody  the only good thing about the film was that it was relatively short,0,
i thought this was a really well written film  i ve heard of radio the person before this movie was even created and i can t begin to describe how good cuba gooding jr was in it  it will make the women cry  everyone laugh  and most everyone will leave smiling,1,
working girl kitty  sothern  is engaged to bill  kelly   who neglects her by working long hours at his garage in order to save money for their marriage  after being stood up on her birthday  kitty goes on a double date blind date  where she meets department store heir bob hartwell  hamilton   she falls in love  but leaves him when his protestations of love appear to cover a desire for her to be his mistress  rather than his wife  faithful bill rallies  round to comfort her  and at last she gives in to his repeated requests to reinstate their engagement  pressured in part by bill s support of her family after she loses her job  when bob returns  however  convinced that he wants marriage after all  will kitty follow her heart or her conscience    this film was a lot better than i d expected it to be  the character of bill at first comes off as the sort of loud comic irishman type that jack carson played so often  but kelly  and the script  infuse the character with real compassion and love  and bill turns out to be the best person in the entire group  viewers may find themselves rooting for him against the feckless hartwell  the tone of the film wavers  however  between light hearted romance and a much darker side  especially in the depiction of a dance marathon and a rather horrific accident at bill s garage   the cast is rounded out by the dependable jane darwell as kitty s mother  an impish but not yet thoroughly obnoxious mickey rooney as kitty s younger brother  and spencer charters as kitty s ne er do well father,1,
i was just lucky i found this movie  i ve been taking advantage of walmart s       dvds  because i watch a lot of movies  and very seldom watch television   i graduated from high school in        so i have family and many friends who served in vietnam  this movie really illustrates the pain i ve seen in my friends in dealing with what happened to them over there  i wish more people would see this movie   i think maybe more people could understand what happened to our vietnam vets by watching these excellent actors in the portrayal of one family damaged by that war  the story felt realistic   it isn t mushy  but made me feel what they were going through  i think it helped that martin sheen and emilio estevez were playing father and son   it made their relationship more believable,1,
barry kane  robert cummings  is wrongfully accused on sabotaging a hanger making aircrafts for the war  he goes on the run  meets patricia martin  priscilla lane  along the way  and she joins him to find and bring the real criminals to justice   there are a lot of things wrong with this film  robert cummings was a good actor but he s totally miscast in this role  priscilla lane is pretty but was never a good actress  the story doesn t make a whole lot of sense  and rambles on longer than needed   it wears its patriotism a bit much  but this was made while wwii was in full swing  and there s no ending  it shouldn t work but it does   it s full of bizarre lines and characters that certainly hold your interest   for example  lane says to cummings  while they re falling in love    i wish i could have met you a hundred years ago              lane pays a villain for getting her lunch and cummings and lane join a circus troupe briefly while on the run  also hitchcock s direction was  as always  just great  he throws in some truly amazing shots and sequences  especially the statue of liberty climax    this is not one of hitchcock s classic movie but is still very good and worth catching,1,
the plot of this movie is as dumb as a bag of hair  jimmy smit plays a character that could have been upset by the ridiculousness of the story  he is evil and a wife beater  it s a character as far from his nypd and la law roles as you could possibly get   if you ve thought he had the looks and the acting chops to play the really bad boy role  her s your present   but         mary louis parker wears black miniskirts and little black minidresses throughout the movie   she has always had some of the greatest legs in the history of the movies  this makes the movie well worth it for this leg admirer   i d buy the dvd for this reason only if it was available,1,
i have watched farscape from first episode to now  and i will continue to watch it  the setting and the characters are amazing and the plots are great  the show really keeps me on the edge of my seat and when the show goes off after an hour i keep hoping it will be another hour,1,
i m a huge fan of the spy genre and this is one of the best of these films  the assignment is based on a true story  which has been somewhat embellished for the big screen  and it really takes you on a fun ride  the film has a great cast  starring aidan quinn  donald sutherland and ben kingsley   naval officer quinn is a reluctantly recruited by sutherland after a chance meeting with kingsley who believes quinn to be the famous terrorist carlos the jackal  because quinn so closely resembles carlos  sutherland stops at nothing to recruit him because sutherland is obsessed with the terrorist s capture or death   the training sequences are awesome  quinn is really put to the test by kingsley and sutherland  having to withstand attacks from remote controlled snowmobiles  from eating the same food each day  to being drugged with a hallucinogen  he even has to learn how to make love to a woman the way carlos would   the film has some great action scenes with quinn eluding allies because they believe he is carlos and in his final mission when he is to kill the jackal  throughout the film  quinn must struggle with the new personality he has attained versus his own  will he remain as ruthless and free as carlos or will he once again return to his life of a good husband and father    if you like the spy genre  this is a must see  the action is used only to propel the story of this thriller forward  no gratuitous explosions or fight scenes  rating    of    stars,1,
i would watch this movie every time it was on cable and it never got old  who can forget some of the best lines in film history      johnny s fat boy burgers   johnny s fat boy burgers   and look between the giant melons  i used to wish i could run all over the city in a treasure hunt as fun as this  it s an all time fave and i m happy to hear that it s out on video  i m positive that this is where mtv got its original premise for the road rules series,1,
one of the worst theatrical movies of the year  if not all time  anthony hopkins belittles himself by even appearing in this joke  i can t believe david mamet and ridley scott s name appear on this travesty  the best career move jody foster ever made was turning this one down  julianne moore was as emotionless throughout as a female keanu reeves  gary oldman was of course  his brilliant self  he is a crippled victim of hannibal and the make up is so good  i didn t know it was gary until the final credits  but eaten by trained boars    give me a break  rumor has it that he didn t want his name even mentioned in the credits  and frying and feeding his own brain to ray liotta   i was laughing at the absurdity  no make that stupidity of this flick at this point  i haven t seen so many people walk out of a movie since who s that girl   pay someone else to go for you if you must  but miss this one at all cost,0,
first of all  i really can t understand how some people  enjoyed  this movie  it s the worst thing i have ever seen  even the actors seem to be bored   and i think that says it all   however  i have to give my applause to the opening credits creators   that team seems to have a really good future  that s why i recommend the big studios to watch only the opening credits  and one or two special effects sequences  if they re watched outside this movie  it almost looks like a good movie    better luck  or judgment  next time for the producers of this  this    this  thing,0,
i just finished watching this film  for me  the most outstanding work in this film was the music score  while many silent film scores work very well with their scenes  i feel that this is the best score i ve come across  the mutiny scenes in particular worked extremely well,1,
robin hood  men in tights has received no respect whatsoever  it was hilarious  cary elwes was excellent as the  prince of thieves   and david chappelle  amy yasbeck  patrick stewart  richard lewis and mark blankfield as blinkin all did fine jobs  i will never understand the hostility toward  robin hood  men in tights   but i do know a great comedy when i see one    robin hood  men in tights  receives     out of,1,
this movie was so weak that it couldn t even come up with good cliches to rip off  i love horror movies and will see practically anything  but if i had it to do over again i would have skipped this one entirely  you may think that i m exaggerating  but i challenge anyone to find anything even remotely satisfying or interesting about this piece of garbage  not scary  not funny  not curious  not worth it,0,
possibly the worst movie i have ever seen  pathetic in almost every way   i threw the dvd straight in the bin   i didn t even think it was fair to give it to the local thrift shop   the effects are beyond a joke  the dam control room looks like cardboard  the water looks way out of scale with the backgrounds   nothing works   then there is the limp plot   about as much depth as a scooby doo cartoon   i couldn t wait for them all to drown,0,
oh  good  grief   i saw this movie title in the tv schedules and thought  i must watch this movie  ripping off snakes on a plane  it will be terrible but hopefully laughable too  sounds fantastically bad   well  i was half right   this movie is eye meltingly bad and  sadly  not even unintentionally hilarious  it s just bad  even worse  it takes almost an hour to get to anything resembling action  for the first half of the movie we have to endure some mumbled foreign language  mexican or spanish  apologies for my ignorance  and terrible acting as some woman vomits up live snakes for reasons we only find out later on  then we have to endure even more terrible acting  and we find out that those mumbling in the foreign language could speak english anyway  as the snakes finally get loose on the train and things move from the sedate to the ridiculous   low budget does not always mean  bad  but  in this case  it does  what we have here is a movie given no thought  a terrible script  a bad cast and not even the sense to capitalise on it s very few strengths  i give two marks for a few decent special effects and a whacky ending but that still feels a bit too generous  avoid if you can   see this if you like  stagknight  the wicker man remake  terrible cgi,0,
best in show is certainly christopher guest s funniest and deepest movie yet  the characters are excellently portrayed and the connection of pet to owner adds a new level of comedy to the movie  i ve been a fan of guest since spinal tap but in this movie he has truly achieved what he set out to do in the  mock umentary   a genre he invented and has now perfected,1,
a touching movie  it is full of emotions and wonderful acting  i could have sat through it a second time,1,
this is definitely a  lesser known  comedy short from the     s  the only reason i saw it was because it was on a dvd by kino films featuring non laurel and hardy shorts featuring ollie  they are interesting and historically important  but also generally average to below average for the style film  compared to shorts by chaplin  keaton  arbuckle and lloyd  they are definitely a step below them in quality and humor  also  the accompanying music was pretty poor by the standards of other silent dvds  i ended up turning off the sound due to the inappropriateness of the music to set the proper mood  but  despite this  they are still worth seeing   i ve gotta be honest about this short  it was the last of   on this dvd and by the time i got to it  i was pretty bored with the mediocrity of   of the   shorts  so  it is possible the film might be a little better than a    but certainly  if this is the case  no better than a    the film is a pretty standard short about an incompetent bellboy  nothing especially interesting and there are certainly much better silent shorts out there,0,
this was one of the most emotional movies i have seen  passion  pleasure  pain  despair  sorrow  healing  cleansing and love   the entire movie was spellbinding  everything was done so well  the adaptation from the book  the actors  the sets  the camera shots   this movie touched me deeply in so many ways  it reminded me of the despair that loosing your love can have  and the time it takes to heal that wound  you may love again  but will always be risking the pain that comes with separation    is this not one of the most important age old questions    is it better to have love and lost    than to never have loved before      ascension,1,
once again seeing this kind of movies turns me more and more into english humor  not too often seen on screen since the days of monty python and man about the house  too bad   brenda blethyn  who i first saw in saving grace early in the year  another must see by the way   just excels  as alfred molina does  the rest of the cast  while virtually unknown to me  turns on great performances too  the film starts slowly and gradually gains in pace and amusement   midway i had tears in my eyes from laughing   all in all  a funny english movie  a thousand times better than the supposedly  funny  garbage that comes from hollywood,1,
what an incredible story and what a beautiful film  hat s off to ben daniels  lavinia currier and the great honore de balzac  this captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully  i watched it mesmerized  almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end  this film s execution was almost flawless  simple and pure  it plays with our hearts  guiding us in understanding the strange platonic  absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other s world  both are capable of affection  yet ironically  it s the more  evolved  one who becomes dependent and possessive  unable to accept the other s freedom  it s one of the most fascinating and intriguing look at the many forms of love  and an incredible study on how oppressive and destructive human love can be sometimes    only a rudimentary mind would associate this story with any kind of bestiality,1,
i would like to vent my displeasure at nbc canceling las vegas  the show had been top notch for the past  years  tom sellecks addition was great  he really brought a nice fresh addition to the show  what does nbc have now  lame reality and night time game shows  i mean come on keep the old and tired law and order  not even putting jack mccoy as da can keep the show interesting  gee let s keep quality program like deal or no deal or ed  er should be put out to pasture to  nbc is worse now than it was in pre seinfeld cheers days  with cable and internet  nbc cannot afford to fall flat on its face please bring back vegas  i remember when homicide life on the street ended the way it did  at least they had a two hour series final  hey cbs are you listening  please pick up vegas it is a great show,1,
no  i m not kidding with this one  he was a guest reviewer for entertainment weekly and gave this movie positive marks  and who can blame him  this is a charming  upbeat  and rather funny disney movie  who doesn t love kittens  the music in ev rybody wants to be a cat is jamming  it makes me want to snap my fingers or something  only years later when cats don t dance came out have i seen a movie that was that musically fun  what aristocats lacks in animation and story  it makes up for in charm  plus  everything moves at a relaxed pace  and even the villain isn t all that scary  it s perfect for the younger set while not being so sappy that adults can t like it  if snoop was here  i m sure he would say the same thing  yeah  dig those crazy cats  man,1,
there s no point in comparing this with the original series  though different in look and content  both are true to the original idea  that is  an sf horror anthology series  due to indifferent scheduling in australia  i ve only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons  the very first episode really did give me the creeps  nightmares at my age       but a number of others did fall flat  generally when the stories moved into horror realms and away from sf  i only hope the dvds reach us eventually,1,
this is a pretty silly film  including what may well be the least erotic come on ever to make it to the big screen  the heroine pours v   all over herself and invites the hero to lick it off    yuck    and yet it also features the resplendent lucinda dickey in what is far and away her most erotic performance  in those long ago days  women    even action heroines    with real muscles were a rarity  and i can still remember the way my jaw dropped when dickey took off her shirt  revealing the most powerfully built female back and biceps i d ever seen  dickey s beauty and vitality carry the film  she could have been a female schwarzenegger if anybody had had the vision to promote her,1,
this movie is stupid and i hate it    i turned it off before it reached half i hate this movie  amitabh sucks in this movie i wanna throw eggs at the person who directed this movie  this movie is stupid and i hate it    i turned it off before it reached half i hate this movie  amitabh sucks in this movie i wanna throw eggs at the person who directed this movie  this movie is stupid and i hate it    i turned it off before it reached half i hate this movie  amitabh sucks in this movie i wanna throw eggs at the person who directed this movie  this movie is stupid and i hate it    i turned it off before it reached half i hate this movie  amitabh sucks in this movie i wanna throw eggs at the person who directed this movie  this movie is stupid and i hate it    i turned it off before it reached half i hate this movie  amitabh sucks in this movie i wanna throw eggs at the person who directed this movie,0,
well  i m not about to add to the diatribe that s been  preached  about this film   all i can add is that at no time does it even pretend to be a  historic  picture  unlike  braveheart    titanic  or  the patriot  all of which have very credible and serious historical amendments  purely for theatric effect  possible the worst of excuses     has everyone taken a sense of humor bypass    all i can add is a paraphrase from the good captain macleane    it looked  fantastic and we have a bloody good laugh      one last point  what astonishes me is that there are comments relating to the  modern music  in a historic setting  i wonder if the same people made the same judgment about moulin rouge  i suggest not,1,
i never saw doctor who before  at least not in any focused way   so i was new to the concept  i have to say that the new show works very well  it s funny  it really also ought to say  comedy  in the genre description  many plot turns are only acceptable because of their comedic value   it s well written and it s making a meager budget go a long way  the human dimension is very strong and engaging  which is very rare in current tv shows   i ve seen the first eight episodes  and      were my favorites so far  even types of stories that are all too easy to screw up  with time travel  saving one s dead parents and that sort of stuff  works out amazingly well here   christopher eccleston is a joy to watch as the witty and light hearted though occasionally morose doctor   if they can find a good replacement for him  i ll be quite surprised  but i m willing to give the new guy a chance  there s little doubt  however  that the eccleston episodes are going to go down in history as classics   the relationship between the doctor and rose is particularly refreshing  the doc is much more of a father figure to her than a romantic interest  and yet there are hints of romantic innuendo between them  which however is much more emotional and human than sexual   a good show  the biggest drawback is the low budget   a show like this ought to have better special effects  and why they don t simply use some cheaper effects  i don t know  in this day and age  sfx don t have to cost a bundle   just look at the star wars  revelations fan film     out of,1,
the china syndrome is a perfectly paced thriller and not slow or boring at all  as some people tend to say  the transitions from one scene to another are great and the tension build up in the film will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire two hours  jack lemmon is great  as always  as the somewhat nervous plant operator and jane fonda succeeds again in bringing some real emotions into the story  you can see this film as a political statement of the time  or just as an intelligently made thriller  either way it is definitely worth watching,1,
although coming after three star wars  krull   countless others  this movie would look outdated in the     s      sfx mostly consist of     s videogames effects such as bolts etc  annoying after a short while  you also get a sfx creature that looks like a poor man s version of some tier iv harryhausen monster     sets are mainly ruins in the countryside  with papier mache temples and miniature cities or abodes that makes     s japanese monster movies look like flawless perfection     plot is paper extra thin   hercules must find zeus  seven golden thunderbolts stolen by conspiring gods   zombie tyrants     action mainly consists in retarded  muscled up hercules   check the variety of facial expressions   wrestling cheap     s videogames effects     acting award goes to milly carlucci  third carlucci show biz sister with anna   gabriella    which says all     sfx make other tier ii italian salad bowl movies such as l umanoide   star crash look like masterpieces   well  considering that ferrigno s main acting exploit consisted in impersonating a retarded green monster  wearing a whig and green espadrillas  we ought to be lenient   watch it   forget about it,0,
the theme song often goes through my head after all these years  i was never much of a tv watcher  probably because i was just entering my busy teen years when my family bought our first set in      and it never became part of my life  but from the first episode of lawman i was hooked  and it is the only tv show i ve ever scheduled my week around   intelligent  believable  well written and well acted  and john russell is still to me the most beautiful man i ever saw   peter brown was no dog  either  o    i agree that it is one of the most underrated tv series of all time  i hope i can find some episodes for my grandchildren to watch,1,
currently playing at the      german film festival in australia http   www goethe de ins au lp prj ff   enindex htm thanks to peanutqueen and especially ariesgemini for her rundown on the actors in this ensemble cast   in australia these movies were sub titled in english and while french movies here often get a mainstream release  german movies are still to gather that sort of commercial audience  but like bmws and mercedes when germans get it right i really like their films  like pq the time here went so quickly  lots of laughs from the audience as each of the   men and   women moved down the speed dating line   minutes at a time   while many films are overlong this one i could have watched much more of  it had the sort of characters and character development for a series  given time i will re read ariesgemini    review and reference the actors i liked and their other work with a view to keeping an eye out from them  i agree    most of these actors will go onto bigger and better things  some very good character actors in this fine film  i did see it in the program listed as a mockumentary  mock or otherwise it felt very real  and quite romantic in it s way   viva la deutcsh,1,
i m just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur ozon  i ve seen only   films so far  and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions  not a single non lonely female character out of     and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings   this film is probably the only one  out of four  where this impact is for good   the gay theme is an almost standard part of background for ozon s films  so it doesn t grab the accent  although the looks of the characters might   watch for the feelings  not for their objects   very nice and fleeting  truly like a summer romance  and while being a relaxation to thought and mind  it gives some food for the soul,1,
i really enjoyed the patriot  this movie had less violence and was based on a real life threat that could inevitably destroy our civilization  one line in the movie from wesley mclaren  seagal  stuck out in my mind to be very true of our society   western medicine is in the practice of prolonging illness and i am in the business of curing it,1,
first of all  let me start by saying that i have been a devoted follower of c thomas howell s career ever since  the outsiders  and  the hitcher   he was an up and coming star in the     s   with hits such as  soul man  also  the future was bright for this young actor and he had the potential to go on from there and really assert himself in hollywood  put it this way   tom cruise had a bit part in  the outsiders  while howell had the lead  look at cruise today     but picking material like this drivel will only denigrate howell s career even more   if that was possible  why does he pick stuff like this  a small part in a major movie would be of more benefit to him than this rubbish   essentially the story here takes place in a post apocalyptic world where everybody lives underground where chaos reigns  howell is a shepherd   protecting the flock of various religious leaders by killing off any undesirables  he s a hit man in other words   the sets are so bad  they wouldn t look out of place on a thunderbirds episode  the use of slow motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting  and bad is a kind word here   no continuity  scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever  vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity  oh yeah  and the storyline was pathetic too   i hate writing bad reviews about films   especially those in which i really like the star   but this film is so bad i don t believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it  i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i d spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie   in short   this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film  it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell  come on c   give yourself some credit and wrestle yourself away from these non hit wonders and try to knuckle down and get a good part   however small          and only because there is no setting for,0,
cheers to all the wonderful fans of this film that have not only seen and appreciate it  but  based on the many literate comments  actually get it  i for one have always considered paul mazursky s  tempest  a musing on the shakespeare play of the same name  as has been noted in a few of the other reviews here  on the other hand  if you re looking for a more straightforward adaptation of the play  you should look elsewhere  as an experiment  however  it succeeds just spectacularly  charming  moving  funny  sad  dramatic     it s all of that and much more  cast  locations  script  music are just fantastic  cassavetes and rowland were never better  susan sarandon s turn more than hinted at the great work to come from her in the future  molly ringwald makes her film debut memorable and you just have to love raul julia s performance     he steals the show in several scenes  what s more  the always great cassavetes was confident and assured enough a performer to have let him  a study on what the thematic elements of shakespeare s classic might be life if updated into more  modern times   mazursky s  tempest  burns brilliantly,1,
this was a great movie  it was a completely enjoyable adolescent fantasy  so what makes a movie great  technical details  i think that if that were the sole criteria  our culture would be the poorer for it  so this movie is to  the godfather  as new wave music is to mozart  the point is  it is one of the best movies of it s type i ve seen  the women are all beautiful  as are only seen on california beaches when movies are being made   it has a little of everything  a kind of battlestar gallactica meets baywatch meets the playboy centerfold video meets wayne s world  there is plenty of charm and a reasonable  albeit predictable  storyline that keeps you interested until the next bit of eye candy graces the screen  joe estevez may not have his brothers career  but does a good job of bringing focus to the story as the eternally adolescent uncle bud  contains plenty of expected absurdities such as female rock band playing without the guitars plugged in   was that intentional   if you re attracted to the box  rent the video  you won t regret it  as is promised  it is good non violent erotic fun,1,
i was at wrestlemania vi in toronto as a    year old  and the event i saw then was pretty different from what i saw on the wrestlemania collection dvd i just watched  i don t understand how the wwe doesn t have the rights to some of the old music  since most of those songs were created by the wwf they shouldn t have to worry about the licensing and royalty fees that prevent shows like snl from releasing season sets  its pretty stupid to whine about  but for me hearing demolition come out to their theme music at a wrestlemania in person was a memory that i never forgot  and it didn t exist on this dvd  what is the point of them even owning the rights to this huge library of video if they have to edit it so drastically to use it,0,
a holiday on a boat  a married couple  an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason to this films beginning   i like boobs  no question about that  but when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment  mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim  my anger just rises to a whole new level  take two guys  a husband and another man   put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them  ad a deserted island  subtract all her moral issues  ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments  fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this    the acting is  i would say  good  there are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see  the main female character makes me sick  this is due to her lack of moral values  the man with the most fish get s her attention  even though one of them is her husband  she sees no problem with being unfaithful with  manuel  the other man because  i must do it to survive   how can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is   feet away  and he won t even benefit from it  the female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does  if she doesen t get approval for her actions  she s a victim   i recommend everyone to see this movie  this is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience,0,
ouch  no real need to say anything else  this movie actually had me contemplating suicide  as a huge fan of the wonderful genre that is zombie movies i found this to quite possibly be the worst attempt i have ever been privy too  the film never actually seemed to go anywhere  what was the point to it all  i am left feeling hopeless and lost  hell this was so bad i cant even justify bashing it anymore  i m just gonna go hang myself in the closet  ok now i tried to submit my comment but the server will only accept comments that are ten lines or more  so here it goes    bad  horrible  no where near enough gore  no tits      how can you have a zombie movie without tits  as a matter of fact the female lead had one hell of a rack and the only reason i watched the film to completion was in order to maybe by chance get a glimpse  nope  of course there was one line that does deserve mentioning  a line i am looking forward to using myself someday  when i just feel the need to get my face smacked   this hog isn t going to smoke itself  this movie is bad  so bad,0,
feels like an impressionistic film  if there is such a thing   the story is well told  very poetic  the characters well developed and well acted by the interpreters  or interpreted by the actors       the film delights in its own sumptuous emotions at times and works well  unless you hate such emotion in movies   not so in my case   it s a very humanistic film   the landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in their own right   well done   a good classic for any good film collection,1,
ms  stowe is sensational in this power drama about a secret policeman who interrogates a children s author because he believes she is trying to plant ideas in her writings that are contrary to the state s  this is an incredibly powerful film  both performances are worthy of more recognition as is the message of this movie  put this on your must see list if you can locate it,1,
a rare exception to the rule that great literature makes disappointing films  john huston s beautiful farewell to life and the movies is almost entirely true to the narrative and the spirit of james joyce s short story  a tender meditation on love  death and time expressed in the events of a twelfth night party in middle class dublin circa       unpromising as the material might appear  the film succeeds by its willingness to tell the story on its own quiet  apparently inconsequential terms  rather than force a conventional cinematic shape of plot points and dramatic incidents upon it  only once is the wrong note struck  when old miss julia  a trained singer and music teacher whose voice is supposed to have been cracked by age  not shattered  sings so badly that the audience burst out laughing when i saw this at the cinema  fortunately  the mood of hushed and gentle melancholy is re established in plenty of time for the moment of revelation between the married couple gabriel and gretta conroy in a hotel bedroom as snow begins to fall outside  it s a sad story  i suppose  but the kind that leaves you feeling better  not blue  especially recommended as a date movie   for people in love who aren t frightened of confronting the sweetness and sadness of life,1,
the biggest problem that the tv program key west faced was that it was advertised wrong  if you saw the ads you would think it was a jiggle how  and be sorely disappointed  it was a vastly more complex show than that    i happened to be in key west just before hurricane andrew hit  and i think i actually found myself having a drink or two with some of the cast in rum runners  of course  that was before the show hit  i did see the sailboat that was in the opening go by a few times  and chatted with the guy who you see hacking up coconuts in the opening too  he was a real local  yes  i d love to see this on dvd,1,
i saw the movie yesterday and was shocked by it  but even more shocked by some of the comments i have read here  one person wrote that it was ambiguous if the victim of the torture was guilty or not  therefore    one person wrote that since he wasn t an american citizen  therefore    some people comment that the people in the middle east hate us and want us dead  therefore    so are we saying then that it is right to torture someone who is guilty of a crime  are we saying it is right to torture someone who is not an american citizen  are we saying that it is right to torture someone who may hate us and want us dead  are we saying that  as is written in the geneva convention  the declaration of human rights and the constitution of the united states that  torture is wrong  but some torture is less wrong than others   when does it become  right  to torture  that is why this movie is powerful   it is ambiguous  but not about torture  torture is always wrong  and if we are willing to do it  even in the name of justice and  national security  or  freedom and democracy  then we are wrong and we are evil  we are doing exactly what we are accusing our enemies of doing  and we are calling them  wrong  in the same breath   my favorite line in the film was  if you don t want to compromise join amnesty international   right on,1,
this is  for different reasons  a very very bad action movie  first of all  seagal is terribly out of shape  he looks old and fat  plays like he has to fulfill an annoying obligation and his fight scenes require creative editing or plain replacement  secondly  his opponent is a very weak villain  this is about a smart and mean masterbrain and chestnut does not deliver  so what about the action   well  the two parties permanently shoot at each other in different locations of the alcatraz jail  they shoot wild and bad  because compared to the amount of required ammunition  the bodycount is rather low  there is nothing to save this movie  there is not a single good line and not a single good joke  the little psychological interlude with   er one and judge mcpherson is ridiculous  so what does it have  well  the usual bell helicopters  silhouettes moving in blue light and slow motion  doors riddled with bullets and      watt lights shining through the holes  characters jumping through the air while shooting  loads of weapons coming from nowhere  a long black coat containing a bold black guy and a thin wooden box containing    tons of gold  the pain continues to the very last take  a hopeless approach to lighten up the closing credits  californian beachboy don michael paul was writing and directing  at least this mountain of boredom comes from just one simple mind,0,
probably one of the worst movies ever made  i m still trying to figure if it was meant to be fun  but for sure i had no fun at all  maybe the movie lost something during the english italian translation  dunno  for sure i miss the guts to watch it again in original version   my rate for it       and i feel like i m being pretty generous  let s say   point is for liv cause she s a nice babe  and the other point is for those decent actors that got trapped into a worthless  useless and pathetic movie   take care  alex,0,
apparently this was an award winner  apparently someone had a gun against his her head and was force to nominate maize  the movie   or this must have been a mistake   this is the most unwatchable movie ever made  the screening and the editing is the biggest horror of this movie  two little girls get lost in a cornfield and get stalked by someone who can be heard laughing under his rubber mask  the little girls run into their hero dad  and then runs away from him  w t f   the hero dad in the movie keeps losing track of them in the few minutes of watching this   the girls obviously weren t trained actors  and had no common sense to them  they were so annoying and so infantile in the movie  it not even remotely comedic  hearing them scream over and over again like a broken record was the reason why i got up and left  you can t even listen to this movie without nearly going into convulsions   i can puke a better award winner than this garbage,0,
this film was released soon after the conan films  a sort of female conan  red sonja played by sylvester stallones ex wife brigitte nielsen  she s not a very good actress unfortunately as proved in rocky iv and cobra  the whole film feels cheap  but strangely arnold swarzenegger appears in this film but not as conan  although he looks  acts and fights like conan from the two conan films  i don t know what thats about  anyway he only appears about every twenty minutes and doesn t hang around for long  maybe arnold filmed this in his time off from filming conan the destroyer or something  anyway the film is way to slow and boring for an action film  skip this and watch conan the barbarian instead,0,
i saw this movie on a fluke i was standing on   nd street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started passing out free tickets for a preview of this movie i gave it a chance not expecting much the promotional movie posters i ve seen on the subway station walls do not give this film justice at all   the movie is about a young rocker who goes on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy metal i ll leave it there the movie is a heavy comedy and lot s of fun if your are old enough to remember when heavy metal dominated the music scene in the eighties you are going to love this film jack black is an amazingly talented comedian and actor and assuming he really wrote and performed the songs in this film he is also a talented musician   tenacious d is definitely worth a look,1,
there are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how i felt about this film so ill keep it short    the grinch  i thought was marvellous   jim carrey is a truly talented  physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor  in my opinion   mike myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying  i used to like him very much in his  waynes world  and  so i married an axe murderer  days   but ive never been fond of austin powers and  the cat in the hat  has just finished me off    this film was horrible   the gags were horrible  inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they havent amused anyone for    years  the plot was messy  messy  messy  its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was  mom   they probably could have picked a better villain than alec baldwin   but he could have pulled it off if it weren t for myers ugly  revolting over acted portrayal of the cat   i mean   did myers even glance at a script  was one written  the other actors seemed to have one   but the cat just seemed to be winging it   on the other hand i would like to mention that the sets and props were marvellous    but unfortunately they cant save this film   poor dr seuss   the man was a genius  dont ruin his reputation by adapting his work in a such a lazy  messy way,0,
i m normally not a drama feel good movie kind of guy  but once i saw the trailer for  radio   i couldn t resist  not only is this a great film  but it also has grreat acting  cuba gooding jr  did an excellent job portraying james robert kennedy  a k a   radio   ed harris also did a fantastic job as coach jones  i was pleasantly surprised to see some comedy in it as well  so for a great story  great acting  and a little comedy  i give  radio  a    out of,1,
if this was the best dutch cinema had to offer these years  my worst fears have come true  i have never  even in dutch movies  seen worse acting  i couldn t get myself to watch it for more than    minutes  so if that s the cause of me missing the genius  so be it,0,
the credits come from the sandy frank stitching job that was made to turn this movie into cave dwellers for re release  now that that s cleared up   oh  excruciating  eye gouging pain  blade master leaps shamelessly on the sword   sorcery bandwagon started by the conan flicks   except the bandwagon never left the garage anyway  as such  this italian flick is a dud trying to rip off a box office dud  with predictable results  however  this would give too little credit to the director and writers  who make no effort whatsoever to maintain a coherent plot  continuity  any semblance of era accurate continuity  miles o keefe is no leading man  now or forever  tarzan the ape man proved that  if ator didn t   just an unlikeable picture and a chore to watch,0,
you know  people who make comedies so often forget it s really ok to be outrageous  well  not this time  unconditional love has it all  barry manilow and a dwarf in a movie with cathy bates as the romantic lead   and it works  not only does it work  it works very very well  in fact  i think it s perfect  i laughed so hard i think i hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human  so honest  and so very real  but isn t that where great comedies come from  don t characters need real feelings  real emotions  and the ability to feel real pain  well  they do in this movie  unconditional love is a movie you shouldn t miss  especially if you need a seriously good laugh  or you re at all curious about seeing the psychotic dwarf in the red raincoat,1,
the blame of this terrible flick lies with the director  martin campbell  after viewing a few of his credits in later years  this must have been one of his first directorial gigs  he had a more than decent cast to work with but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing  there were scenes that made absolutely no sense at all  where was his head               was he on drugs  i was looking forward to this movie just because of oldman   bacon  maybe it was a short shooting schedule and campbell just had to  bang it out   i can t imagine that the story that campbell directed even came close to the story that the writer wrote  oldman   bacon  along with the rest of the cast  must have slid under their chairs if they went to the screening  as one poster pointed out  karen young did do a pretty good fight scene with bacon  she really did  let loose   it s unfortunate that i have to fill in more space just to stay within the guide lines of what the imdb requires because i really don t have anything more to say about this uninspiring film  one does not have to be forced to be a  windbag  when criticizing a terrible flick and wish that the imdb would change the amount of words to fill up a critique,0,
probably this is the best film of clint eastwood  here action is minimal  but with plenty of good acting  a yankee soldier eastwood is wounded and taken by the female pupils and teachers of a school in the south  where he is hidden and taken care  shortly after his recovery all ladies wanted to have fun with him  and some of them succeeded including the director of the school geraldine page   erotic scenes are coming until the ladies discovered that their  macho  was shared by several of them  so they became angry and poisoned him in a farewell dinner  geraldine page  although somewhat old  was able to play a very suggestive role as the director of the school  a woman with more failures than happiness in her life,1,
this is an excellent james bond movie  although it is not part of the original and more famous series  and it is a standalone film  it is very well done  enticing sean connery to return to the role he made famous was a stroke of genius  as was titling the movie in a way that references his past vow to not play bond again  connery was as great as he was in his earlier     appearances  the script is outstanding  as are the photography and the performances  it s the earliest movie i recall with kim basinger  who became much more famous after this film  barbara carrera was excellent  and klaus maria brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain  the frequent references to the aging of bond and the changing times and attitudes of the british secret service were most humorous  the     gadgets equaled those of the other bond films  the only thing missing was the famous     music theme  which  of course  could not be used by this competing production  it was rather amazing to me to be able to see two excellent james bond movies released in the same year  this one and octopussy with roger moore  an interesting aspect of the film is an emphasis on video games and computer graphics  the early    s were the first heyday of such things  and the use of them in this film made it a very contemporary movie  the film is actually a different version of thunderball  updated with newer technology  regardless of the repeated theme  there are sufficient differences to make it most entertaining  i will watch this one frequently,1,
watched this flick on saturday afternoon cable  man  did it drag  i got the metaphors  symbolism  and all that stuff  no  i didn t care one way or another about the sexuality of the characters  but  the pacing of the story and the scripting almost put me to sleep   that is      until ruth marshall got naked  if you re a breast man who is not homo phobic  you may want to rent it  ruth has a lesbian sex scene that s pretty hot  and then a hetero sex scene that is a notch higher than most standard movie fare  her jiggly d cups made the film worth the watch     the mighty avatar,1,
i have fond memories of watching this when it came out  it s one of those films that you know is rubbish  even when you re a kid  but at that age you overlook the ludicrous acting  special effects and plot  so there s a race of big busted nymphets living underground  huh   and just enjoy the campy monsters for all they re worth,1,
people have often been uncomfortable with  the merchant of venice   due to its anti semitic subject matter  fortunately  this movie avoids that  opting instead to show how anti semitism reigned supreme in   th century europe  the story  of course  is that antonio  jeremy irons  needs money so that he can help bassanio  joseph fiennes  ask for portia s  lynn collins  hand in marriage  he gets the money from jewish usurer shylock  al pacino   who demands a pound of antonio s flesh if the latter doesn t pay back the loan  when antonio can t pay back the loan  shylock is determined to get what is owed him   we would expect this cast to do a good job  and they don t disappoint  it is yet another testament to what a great actor al pacino is,1,
from the first    seconds of pitch black i was hooked  i had walked into this movie thinking that it would be just another cheesy sci fi movie  instead i found a highly entertaining  on the edge of your seat  thought provoking action film  the movie goes beyond your basic special effects flick  the actors are amazing  radah mitchell  high art  love and other    as fry is truly a joy to watch on screen  while vin diesel as riddeck is so captivating that you are dying just to hear him speak again   the look of the movie is breath taking  the contrast of blues  yellows and oranges due to the three different suns is amazing  followed by the complete darkness of nightfall  i would truly recommend any lover of the alien movies or radha mitchell  which is why i went to see it  to check out this film  i m sure by the end you ll look at the dark in a whole new way,1,
the premise of this movie  of a comedian talk show host running for president as an independent just to shake things up  is funny  entertaining  brilliant and even a bit inspiring   thought about the west wing debate when tom dobbs leaves his podium  thought about steven colbert announcing his candidacy  good times  the first         minutes of this movie are therefore very very entertaining  the debate especially  when he eventually get s elected  it s a pity that is because of a computer glitch  you d want him to win fair  although that is unrealistic    but after that this movie goes completely downhill  i thought we d get a great movie like  dave         in which we see how it would out if a comedian actually ran the country  instead  the movie turns from comedy into a thriller  a romantic comedy and a drama and does none good  the computer glitch becomes the main storyline  which really sucks  boy is this disappointing  i give it   stars just for the premise and because i actually managed to watch this movie from start to end without stopping it  which is usually a good thing with me,0,
i m sorry  but this movie is just way to shallow for me  in it  perez is a taxi dancer with boyfriend keitel trying to make it as an actress  first of all  what the hell is a taxi dancer  even after sitting through this  i still don t know  oh yeah  perez also inspires delorenzo to follow her like a lovesick puppy  there s no reason behind the love  it just kind of happens  there are times when the characters and events really try to pull at your heartstrings  but it rarely works  the only character you really do feel anything for or with is keitel s character  and that s only because he does such a good job with it  any other actor and the character would have been just like the others   the script is basically an uninspired rehashing about how hard it is to make it as an actor actress  it s been done and said before  the language and dialog sounds like it was written by a street pimp  the ending is   well  i don t want to spoil it  let s just say it feels unsatisfying  i d be more upset if the story was any good to begin with  the directing is average with nothing truly wonderful  but nothing that is really painful to watch either  to reiterate the acting  the only one that does anything worth watching is keitel  though i could have lived on without seeing him in tiger print bikini underwear   oh yeah  eddie bunker shows up  as random as that mention is  that s how random it is in the film  and tarantino does his director buddy a favor by showing up for about    seconds,0,
as americans  we have come to expect crapiness as  par for the course  when it comes to horror and unknown directors directing unknown actors acting for unknown writers  we truly expect this to suck   when they don t suck it becomes an over night success   this is not an over night success  nor is it an over the weekend or over the month success  this blows from start to finish and my only recommendation is this  go into this knowing it sucks  enjoy it for what it is  for what it isn t   if you have something better to do  keep this on the back way back burner  it s entertaining in the way watching the elderly cross a busy street during rush hour  but don t expect much they almost never get hit by an actual car  its just a lot of hoopla,0,
i love this film  there is something for everyone  it if funny  saddening  passionate and dramatic  the mixture of two completely different cultures creates a whole new world that the viewer cannot help but want to be a part of  i must admit that i am slightly biased  as colin firth is my favourite actor and so nothing that he does is wrong in my eyes      but in this film his tremendous acting talent is apparent and it is furthered even more by the beautiful acting of his co star nia long  the problems that their love affair suffers makes it  ironically  more believable and the simple features like the contrast between the colours of matthew s and nimi s clothes alone  makes this film all the more enchanting  i defy anyone that cannot be moved by this story  i find it enchanting and have watched it at least ten times since i bought the film a week ago,1,
while the movie has its flaws  it brings to light some of the problems that come with living in a country that has no democracy  it makes you empathize with the people under such a government and makes you want to learn more about their lives  their struggles and a potential leader aung san suu kyi  it makes one wonder why our government will interfere places we are not wanted yet ignore those who ask our help,1,
i have loved this movie since i saw it in the theater in       i was    then and wil wheaton was my favorite actor and adolescent crush  i am now    and i still love this movie  the best part about it is whoever i am dating loves it too because it is a total macho guy movie  it is wrought with enough action and mayhem to keep men with the shortest attention spans glued to the screen  i only wish that it was available on dvd,1,
my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago  and  i must say  this is the single best movie i have ever seen  i mean  woah   dude  we better get some brew before this joint closes  and  dude  linda s not wearin  a bra again   what poetry  woah  and it s such a wonderfuly original movie  too  i mean  you don t usually find a slasher film where every single murder is exactly the same  i mean  exactly  now that s originality  and almost all the transitions between scenes are these great close ups of the psycho in the er scrubs  how cool  the acting is so wonderful to  the dad was just brilliant  must have studied real dads before filming  and how many movies do you find that just don t make any sense  not many  but this is one of those gems  i mean  how cool is it that one guy waited outside for like six hours to pull a prank  while his friends were both inside  that s really cool  overall i d say this is the single greatest film of the genre  nay  in the world,0,
this film was made right in the area where i grew up and now live  i know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film  as a teenager  i worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with ron perlman  jonathon furr  and the car  i am told that jonathon furr and ben allison are are natives of nc  i was fortunate to see it at a local showing  at that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props  such as the bus       greyhound  used in the movie  the bus had no reverse gear and during filming  the driver missed his stopping point a few times and had to drive several miles to return to the proper point  those details of the technical issues added to the enjoyment for me  the film accurately depicts life in this area during wwii  a well done film and i anxiously await the dvd availability,1,
i have not figured out what the chosen title has to do with the movie  this is another gathering of monsters just like the house of frankenstein  not exactly a masterful plot  but universal needed to capitalize again   dr  edelman  onslow stevens  is either very ambitious or over the top in the ego department  he is working on the cure to keep larry talbot from turning into the wolf man  somehow count dracula happens to drop by to get a fix on his vampirism  and rounding out the good doctor s experiments is the restoring of the frankenstein monster s energy  along the way  the kind hearted doctor s blood is tainted with that of dracula   john carradine plays dracula again  this time he is more convincing  lon chaney jr  as usual is the soulful wolf man  glenn strange is the frankenstein monster  who has very little to do this outing  also with mentionable roles are lionel atwill and martha o driscoll,0,
river s edge is an excellent film and it s a shame that it hasn t made more of a mark for itself in cinematic history  there were a number of gritty films based around school kids made in the eighties  but of all the ones i ve seen  this is certainly the most nihilistic and disturbing  the film takes a storyline that is disturbing in its own right and adds the theme of teenage slackers and their uncaring attitude about things  which takes the story onto another level  the film works because the central story is interesting and it s played out by complex characters  the film begins with a murder  we then follow the murderer  nicknamed john  as he goes back to school and tells all his friends about what he has done  rather than give the expected reaction  most of them hardly react at all and the strongest reaction that the murderer gets comes from layne  who makes it his number one priority to help john clear up the mess he s in and get him out of it  the other friends mull over the crime  and before long one of them goes to the police     river s edge features a host of great performances from its young cast  keanu reeves has a reputation for wooden acting  and for good reason  but he fits in very well to this early role and this performance is easily one of his best  crispin glover is the biggest standout as the slightly insane layne  glover always stands out in every film he s in  and while he does go over the top a little bit  he convinces well as the lead in this movie  reeves and glover receive good support from a talented young cast that includes daniel roebuck and joshua john miller  as well as the great dennis hopper in another wild role  the film features a very gritty picture which bodes well with its nihilistic tone  the central characters are all of the  slacker stoner  generation and the way that they genuinely don t seem to care about the murder of their friend is more shocking than the murder itself  and the point that the film tries to make about modern society is both strong and well defined  the film is also rather funny  owing to some of the characters  lines  but the humour is pitch black and clearly this film was never meant to be a comedy  overall  this is an excellent and memorable film that is definitely worth seeing,1,
journey to the far side of the sun is about the discovery of a planet on the other side of the sun which shares the same orbit as earth and therefore has been undiscovered until a space probe on the far side of the sun photographs it  of course two astronauts  roy thinnes   ian hendry  are sent to explore it but due to a malfunction they crash   find themselves back on earth only   weeks into their six week journey  of course they re berated  at least thinnes is  hendry is gravely injured  and grilled and asked why they turned back on their mission but it s claimed that they didn t  until thinnes seems to notice a few very odd things about being back  home   this is excellent if somewhat talky at times  and the sets and feel aren t a far cry from  thunderbirds  territory but will live actors for once  it s no big  star wars  type production but more quiet science fiction that one has to think about a bit  well worth seeing and it s criminal that the dvd is out of print    out of,1,
well  let me put it this way   i have always been one of the  hardcore brothers   i ve always loved rock music  and especially heavy metal   that s why this movie is like a gift from god  i believe this movie is one of the best movies ever  well  except from neverending story and star wars  of course       it s great to hear all the classics  like  long live rock and roll   dio    stranglehold  ted nugent   songs by jon bon jovie  deep purple  ac dc  zakk wylde and several other legendary rock bands  heavenly  absolutely gorgeous  wonderful    i hope they will make more movies like this  otherwise it s just crap movies  like that  ac in da usa  or what they call it  and    miles   bulls       well  i strongly recommend this anyway  everything i m missing is a couple of stratovarius songs  but except from that  it s one of the best movies ever  ten out of ten,1,
though this film destroyed director and screenwriter michael cimino s career and bankrupted united artists  it still stands as one of the top movies of all time  there are plenty of reasons to prematurely dismiss this movie for sure  among them  its length  its technical problems  its colossal mistreatment of animals on set    the list goes on and on  and yet  for all of this  it remains a film that captures something  it is a classic example of naturalistic storytelling on par with strindberg    its moments lasting as long as they might in reality  having not been dumbed down for good cinematic timing  it feels real in its moments of anger  love  and war  and hopelessness   this film should be seen by any person who appreciates film and storytelling,1,
well how can i categorise farscape without resorting to gushing superlatives  ok  here goes  the scripts are fantastic  with each episode offering so much entertainment  drama  humour and sheer watchability  the casting is perfect especially that of zhaan  the blue lady  played by virginia hey  each character has a depth that just isn t there on the star trek series   i think having an australian spin on the show makes this for me  australia has been knocking out quality films for years and farscape is no exception   i have only seen the first four episodes in uk order and they have a quality that makes each    minute show  in the uk  stand out more like a film than a weekly tv series   the episode that really does it for me is  i  et  which turns the alien concept around where moya  a living ship  even the spacecraft has a great character  is forced to land on a planet that has yet to make  first contact  and is surprisingly earth like and crichton meets a radio telescope operator and  he  is the  little green man  to them  gripping stuff   in short the effects are great  the scripts are top quality and the main characters  not one of them really given any more importance than any other  are interesting  not always  good  and well just excellent   roll on the second season,1,
don t let the wildly varying reviews of the movie deter you  you ll love it or hate it according to your own tastes  however  if for no other reason  see  greystoke  to experience the excitement of a great actor grabbing your heart as he breathes life into his role  ralph richardson was not a great actor for how perfectly he could handle shakespeare  rather  he is to be remembered for his sensitive treatment of every character he portrayed  he was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor  his reading of the part of the sixth lord of greystoke  his last performance  is to be cherished by all who love the theatre,1,
it s really good to see van damme s film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to c grade flops  derailed  and  second in command  which were both tragic and not in a good way  the sheperd  border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action fight sequences  it s good to know that van damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film  until death  had no martial arts in it at all     that being said  this film is significantly inferior to  until death  which was a really good turn for van damme   until death  lacked the over the top action of most van damme films but was dark and gritty and van damme s performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film  still  the shepherd is definitely a film worth checking out especially for van damme fans or just action movie fans in general but if you re looking for a film with a bit more story line     you may want to skip this one   i do believe that this film was done well enough especially on what little budget it would have been shot on  the only real problem i have with this film is the title   the shepherd   i don t get it  i suppose  border patrol  just doesn t have the same ring to it without the word  shepherd  in front of it     my rating for this film is   out of    but that s by van damme movie standards not in any other film category   i e  it s good for a van damme film,1,
i ve been waiting years for the dead to come out on video  having pretty much worn my vhs copy to shreds  this is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays  it takes place on the feast of the epiphany  twelfth night   and is a simple  poignant vignette of characters attending a dinner prepared by three dublin women  central to the story is a fairly loveless couple  a wife who once passionately loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife  but feels incapable  all of the performances are stunning  and the script weaves among the various characters at the dinner beautifully  of course  its source material is james joyce s short story of the same title  and much of his narrative structure is kept fully intact  john huston s long career as one of hollywood s greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting finale with this film  which was scripted by his son  tony huston  stars his daughter  anjelica huston  and is dedicated to his wife  maricella  thank you to lions gate for picking up the rights to this film and releasing it on dvd  for lovers of all things irish or for folks looking for a literate  subtle  yet incredibly moving holiday film  this is a true gem,1,
mankind s self awakening is the theme of        a space odyssey   a process that unfolds along a space time continuum  we  see  our primordial past  and we  infer  a cosmic future  the powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception  in our ongoing collective journey   from this transcendental perspective  a conventional  egocentric plot seems superfluous  our frenzied conflicts and self important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change  and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension  it s a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species  not surprising then that some of us huff and puff about the film s slowness and minimal story  for perceptive viewers  the remuneration is an inspirational sense of wonder and awe   in this film  which is mostly visual  geometric symbols guide our intuition  circles and arcs represent nature  right angles represent conscious intelligence  some people think the sleek  black monolith is a von neumann probe  maybe  without doubt  the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown  mystery is more profound than explanation               is unique among films in content and scope  the cinematography is out of this world  the special and visual effects are breathtaking  and the classical music is sublime  i rarely use the word  masterpiece  to describe a movie  but stanley kubrick s        a space odyssey  is art in the highest sense  like leonardo da vinci s  mona lisa   or vincent van gogh s  the starry night,1,
the outsiders is undoubtedly a classic australian tv series  well defined characters  tight scripts  varied and interesting locales  great guest stars and a filmic ambiance all combined to make this series a special one   sadly  andrew keir has passed on   sascha hehn from germany does not appear  unfortunately  to have enjoyed small screen success in his native country  the abc has repeated the series many times yet a dvd release is yet to happen   the series is one which is timeless  it is as likely to strike a resonant chord with viewers today as it did in its own day  come on abc   release the outsiders on dvd,1,
spoilers   i gave this film   out of    for   scenes that i will never forget     by the way  my husband rented this surprising non blow  em up almost chick looking flick   but i guessed why when i saw the cover    girls in school uniforms    duh    lol    ah well  men if ya can t beat  em join  em          bijou philips  one of my favorites on the indie screen   too cute      not only gets into bestiality  her toy dog is the best lesbian in town according to her bubbly outrageous character   that would be the first worthwhile scene    then she enters a restroom in a lovely gown   goes into a stall    after a bit she gets up  goes out to the party she   the pathetically sad  cat  character are at   hands a shiny silver ice bucket to the host of the party   the host looks in her precious silver ice bucket and says   oh my god it s poo    i love bijou phillips myself for her creativity and unusual movie choices  this would definitely be one of them    and um  i would rent it for the poo scene if i were you     i am not a big poo jokes fan  but it definitely puts the  party people  in their place  they didn t look like they were having a good time anyway     lol    you will never forget these two scenes   hmm  but is that what we want in our databanks     maybe you shouldn t follow my advice at all    lol  dominique swain is kind of squirrelly   sad in her confusing nonsensical role in  tart   i don t know  i can t decide if i like her because she is so into indie films   indie films are awesome   all but couldn t she pick a few good ones  i am going to check out a few more of her movies and reserve judgment     but this one was   pardon the reference to beasts  a dog,0,
this is a disgrace to the name of all of the lovable and laughable critters  saga  why do the writers feel the need to make the movie unbearable to watch by all quality standards  the critters are cute and adorable as ever but deadly behavior has been transformed into that of a killer baby  they aren t as terrifying  gruesome  some what spine  chilling and funny as they were portrayed in the movies before  i used to love their porcupine shots but now it is hidden as if it was thought to be repetitive and boring  and what is with the killing and not eating  i thought this movie would have been cool but everything was so wrong  why did ug have to be evil and killed by that which is known as charlie  this movie sickens me  disgrace  disgrace  disgraaaaaaace,0,
cuba gooding jr  will win the oscar for best actor in      and ed harris will win for best supporting actor  what a beautiful and poignant film it is but be sure to bring along a box of tissues because if this film doesn t get to you  then you have ice water in your veins   it was       the setting was in south carolina and the civil rights act was about ten years old  we have a white high school football coach and teacher  ed harris  then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow  cuba gooding  whose greatest possessions  including a radio  are piled into a shopping cart which is also used as his bicycle   ed harris takes a keen interest in the fellow for a reason explained much later on in the film  he gives cuba the nickname  radio  and what follows is an absoutely riveting  engrossing  poignant exploration of the human soul   the movie is nothing short of a masterpiece,1,
i had a bad feeling when i saw the cheap title work  it only took a couple of scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker  the only enjoyment i got out of this was to laugh at the technical flaws  example   the background  car sounds  audio just disappears during the scene with danny and dog in dog s car   production shows a total lack of imagination  example   slow motion machine gun fire repeats many times   sandra bullock plays essentially a bit part  completely unnecessary to the plot  to say that this movie actually has a plot is doing more justice to the writing than it deserves  the antique computer hardware is kind of interesting  this film was released in       not      as the imdb database indicates  and then current  high tech  was an amber screen on a     mhz ibm pc with floppy drives  maybe the pc was the real star of the movie    at least it was interesting   we got this on dvd for a couple of bucks in the bargain bin at walmart  as the other reviewer notes  we paid too much,0,
sheba baby is always underrated most likely because it has a pg rating instead of the usual r rating that a grier movie gets  all that the pg means is that pam doesn t take her top off  she takes her top off in every other movie she s been in though so  it is more exciting than coffy  more action  it takes off slow but by the time she s on screen the thrills have started  like dolemite d urville martin is the heavy trying to get sheba s father  but she ain t having that  she wages a one woman war against martin and his gang of cronies  the best scene is with a stupid pimp in his car which i m still laughing about  i thought it would be stupid because of the pg rating but i was wrong it replaces sex with violence and in a blaxplotation film that can only be good,1,
one cannot help but admire mike judge for his hands on  i ve experienced that  approach  with  office space   almost anyone working a job could associate with the characters   idiocracy  has exactly the same feel to it  one can easily appreciate the     years later experience of our heroes  because again  the director has tried to put things on a very human level  somewhat similar to woody allen s  sleeper   this movie is very funny  do not miss the deleted scenes as the  museum of fart  is a classic  imaginative comedy is a rarity  and  idiocracy  is wildly imaginative  extremely funny  and a solid     movie experience    merk,1,
this movie is funny if you re the gentleman who was sitting about three rows behind me  repeating every punchline  laughing when there were no gags on screen  and issuing a gravelly  haaaa  at every scene involving a computer or mobile device    for everyone else  it s a mean spirited  bungled  comedy   the movie strictly follows the formula of the later  scary movie  films  as well as  epic movie  and  meet the spartans   though without the flood of heartless pop culture references that made the latter two so irritating  still  the lampooning of intellectual and peacemaking figures the world over makes it clear that the film knows its audience  people who envy brainpower   superhero movie  is particularly and consistently nasty to stephen hawking  introducing him as a sex starved druggie and using his disability as a vehicle for slapstick   the plot is based on  spider man   with  batman begins  and  x men  thrown in just to deliver some physical comedy  much of the movie is slapstick  but not in any invigorating or interesting way  the longest running gag is a fart joke  and early on the scriptwriters seem to believe that having the main character get thrown in conspicuous piles of fake animal poo automatically enlivens an otherwise uninspired rehash of the spider bite scene from  spider man   perhaps the only redeeming feature of this feature is the energy in it  notably absent in other recent parodies  the filmmakers act as though they re doing something new  and the audience can feel the influence in the way the actors bounce around the screen  an extremely abbreviated length  about an hour and fifteen minutes  and the zest of the presentation makes  superhero movie  tolerable rather than horrifying,0,
this was probably intended as an  arty  crime thriller  but it fails on both counts   there are few thrills and not enough substance  the plodding pacing makes it hard to sit through  and the occasional action scenes are too sloppily edited and confusingly staged to offer much compensation  at least the level of acting is high,0,
this attempt at a  thriller  would have no substance at all  some may state that this movie  has it all   autism  arson  robbery  lost love  a bag of money  cut throats  murder  blood  a snub nosed revolver  clenched teeth groaning  boobs  various definitions can be used   large flashlights  tribal people  a brother duo attempting to out portray  dumb and dumber   white wolves  fight scenes that resemble  happy slapping   snow mobile s   a large tracked vehicle  and a motel under renovation  all this  with an  enyanesque  melody toward the end      perhaps my rating is a bit harsh  but one viewing will certainly be enough for the sane cinemaphile with nothing else to do    yeowza,0,
i was surprised that   forgiving the franklins   did not generate more buzz at this years sundance film festival  there were times that the laughter at the screening i saw was so loud that you could barely hear the movie  the movie has some excellent acting and a story that really makes one examine broader issues   you know little issues like religion  sex and the truth  lots of comedy s seem to rely on the same old corny contrived situations  many leave you thinking   i know they ripped this off from some sitcom    this film takes off on its own unique direction   i really think that jay floyd did a fantastic job with a tight budget on this film,1,
it s nice that these three young directors have produced films with good productions values and decent acting  there s some good work here   unfortunately they suffer from what afflicts much of modern gay cinema  recycled plots  too familiar devices  i have seen the  pool  setting way too many times in gay male films  and hackneyed scripts  most egregious of all is  dorothy  whose preposterous premise is that a cute young guy will have trouble getting laid in nyc due to a shortage of identifiable availabe gay guys in his vicinity   in terms of cinema these shorts play like tacky little gay afterschool specials  not a lot of imagination in their writing or execution  basically they follow a point and shoot  shot reaction shot master shot convention which becomes painfully dull after five or so minutes  there s hope for queer cinema in the works of todd haynes  sadie benning and the late  great marlon riggs   but not here  these films are incredibly middlebrow  singularly whitebread and their values basically pander to a gay bourgeois sensibility  which is probably why they play so well at gay film festivals,0,
do not see  mr  magoo   it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen  leslie nielson was not funny in it  he has not been funny since the naked gun movies  well it won t take long to figure out that this is not a naked gun movie  the movie s plot is ridiculously foolish  nothing in the entire movie was funny  the first few minutes of the film were animated to look like the old magoo cartoons  i wish the movie would have stayed that way,0,
retro puppet master is complete and utter crap in particular the puppets look stupid and crappy the acting was unforgivable and the story was rancid this movie goes back into the the past where the dolls where first created thats not puppet master retro puppet master is rated pg    the first puppet master to be rated pg    the movie contains no horror or suspense the fact that this movie was a puppet master film boggles the mind because this installment doesnt have the buckets of blood good acting or any entertaiment like the previous movies did dont see this movie dont rent it and dont even watch it f its on tv because this film is stale not violent and completely crappy   out of    as a puppet master fan i am disappointed   seriously,0,
look  don t get me wrong i love independent films but come on  i could barely sit through it without wanting to kill myself  the director had absolutely no talent and he turned something that could have been ok to a f   ing nightmare  i am a punk enthusiast myself and even the music sucked  the acting was crap   i am usually a bleeding heart for these low budget films but this one  this one didn t even try  please don t waste your precious time and money  i am sorry to be so harsh but come on  it dragged on and and on and on  remember when the kids got into that party with the weird cupcakes and the watermelon martinis  how did they just blend in  it made me frustrated how they could just go anywhere they wanted and get into trouble and have sex and a  meaningful conversation  with whoever they wanted  i know im blathering but my mind is just buzzing with everything i hated about this film,0,
this movie is on cable sporadically  and i never really watched it  thinking it would be similar to the bruce willis film   n america   with the usual trite story about american freedom  etc  but it was not  it was so much more    of course  martin sheen is excellent   i have never seen him in a movie i haven t loved  even if the script is bad  because he is so talented   kathy bates is the overbearing mom  and does a great job  the real surprise is emilio estevez  who has not always been in the greatest films  but also directed this movie  please don t stereotype him from the  breakfast club  movie  he is so much better in this  and i wish he would do more non commercial  atypical hollywood movies   the film is realistic  as we see emilio home from vietnam  during thanksgiving  kimberly williams is passable as the sister  who feels she is  disgraced and embarrassed  by the returning soldier  her brother  he is quite alienated from the family  and  especially at this time in us history  this story is very relevant   i learned a great deal about post traumatic stress  and you will genuinely empathize with this character  this is not a violent  journalistic portrayal  like  platoon  for example  it is more of a character study  which leaves us even more intrigued and concerned about the effects of war  especially when one considers the young age of the soldiers who are victims  with today s violence  it is rare that a movie causes one to genuinely feel sad  and shed a tear  this does it  and deserves recognition,1,
don t pay any attention to the rave reviews of this film here  it is the worst van damme film and one of the worst of any sort i have ever seen  it would appeal to somebody with no depth whatever who requires nothing more than gunfire and explosions to be entertained   seeing that this is directed by peter hyams it has made me realise that peter has no talent as a director  but is very good at filming explosions and the like  however  movies need other elements as well  for example  a story  this one didn t have one  this might explain the awfulness of some of mr  hyams  more recent films  hardly any better than this one  really   one can t help wondering how some people ever were put behind a camera,0,
just got into viewing program for the first time recently   the   hour  kidnapping  program  don t know why i didn t sooner   james caan is outstanding and wholly believable in the role as the chief honcho at the featured    vegas complex   so often  programs like this have one or more in the ensemble who are either outright annoying  or seem to have been picked because they must be related to the producer or director   that is certainly not the case with this program  along with caan  all of the primary and supporting cast are engaging attractive  and believable  the guest actors are well chosen    the stories i ve seen are interesting  and the show presents a good view of the city as well   this is an entertaining program  and one i hope will remain  i don t know how i managed to miss it for so long  but plan to tivo it from now on,1,
tempest is based on the classic shakespearean work of the same name  but bears little resemblance to its source material   it masquerades as being as cerebral as its namesake  but instead is a jumbled  convoluted  and hackneyed exercise in tedium  the original probed the premise that people have an evil side  which would be destructive if unchecked  here you just get an uninteresting mid life crisis  yawn  goof ball who is having everything go wrong in his personal and professional life  he becomes endowed with a supernatural power that he uses to try to control his environment  in other words  to get his own way   every few minutes  after something else in his pathetic life goes wrong  he finds a secluded place and starts babbling  show me the magic   while waving his hands around and making a  serious concentration  expression  from the way these scenes are shot  it looks like he s trying to turn bugs into other kinds of bugs  turning a spider into a cockroach  maybe  but by this time  you really don t care   the story has him bolt from his life with his daughter to a greek island somewhere  then have a awkward relationship with some girl he meets  one of the dullest romances ever committed to film  the story just bogs down and moves at a slower and slower pace  you are never given any reason to like or dislike anyone   i ll give this a   because of the beautiful greek location shots and the semi optimistic conclusion  although it isn t clear if the tempest power brought this ending about or not   the spirit of shakespeare s work has been captured much better in other movies  one notable example is  forbidden planet   which gave credence to how the power gets out of control   as for this  tempest   its only magic is to cure insomnia,0,
this film is a refreshing change of pace from the mindless hong kong triad movies i have grown so tired of  there are no spectacular gun fights  no car chases  and practically minimal action to speak of  the audience is kept in suspense for the most part  though certain aspects of the so called  ploy  by andy lau are quite obvious   the film has been hailed as a departure from the genre of violent triad films  and as an  intelligent  crime film  to an extent  it is  but  to some extent  it still fails the  believability  test  one can hardly picture any triad member to be dumb enough to not see through the female disguise of andy lau in a second  it also seemed to have fallen for the  if someone was seriously ill  the said someone will be coughing up copious amounts of blood regularly  thing chinese films seem to go for all the time   the subtle relationship between the two lead characters is a refreshing change   all in all an enjoyable film  even though the concept is not new and there are few surprises,1,
late night on bbc   was on my way to bed but curiosity piqued at a contemporary set irish film so i stayed to watch for a few minutes and then stayed to the end  i have to admit that the main attraction was the only english actress  kelly reilly  who is stunning to look at   this is billed as a black comedy  which is one of the hardest things to pull off  it should be the perfect blend of horror and horrible laughs so that in the end you don t know why you re laughing   for me martin scorsese s after hours        is the best example  dead bodies is more black than comedy but the plot rattles along and spirals down towards further blackness  i didn t spot the final twists in the tale as some other posters here did so i was suitably surprised   as a snapshot of the irish film industry in       it all seems rather worthy  it doesn t look like they spent too much on the making of it so it had a chance to make its money back  the script could ve been a whole lot sharper but the acting was on the whole pretty good  i m glad i watched it  flaws and all  tho i don t think i learnt much about ireland today  especially their policing methods,1,
of course  how could he  he obviously co opted several aspects from that excellent movie  which was also based on the sensational french case of the self described  doctor in the world health organization  who murdered his family and himself when finally unmasked as a fraud  emilio refers to his son as  monster   he sings to the radio in his car  he hangs out on park benches  and he specializes in investment schemes to defraud his family and friends    all of this and more directly lifted from  time out   which came out the year before  nobody s life   it s too bad because this movie is pretty good on its own  with good acting and writing  whereas vincent from  time out  is a much more subtle character who seems to have a sense of ethics even though at times it gets twisted into knots  the protagonist here seems devoid of any character at all save for his winning looks and charm  seriously  the part where he used x rays that show his mother in law s cancer to bilk more money from his father  then utilizes a subtle twist on the same scam to avoid eviction from his fancy home for failing to pay the lease on time    it s almost too much  the guy has no shame whatsoever  in fact  he s more like the lead in  stepfather  than some poor schmuck who gets fired and is so humiliated that he can t face the disappointment of his family and friends and feels forced to invent a shiny new life for himself  as vincent did in  time out   thus  one could feel the tension mounting in  nobody s life  and the violent conclusion coming  one thing  nobody s life  has that  time out  definitely lacked was a love interest apart from the protagonist s trusting wife  it s not hard to understand how the sexy babysitter was able to fascinate and ensnare emile to the degree that he ignored the danger of her natural curiosity and allowed it to lay bare his less than carefully constructed con  given the reservations mentioned  this is a pretty good movie that we found entertaining  if you long for something touching on similar elements that goes a might deeper and is more intellectually and spiritually satisfying  i strongly suggest  time out,1,
kinda boring  kinda gross  kinda unsettling  this wasn t horrible  but not too good  there s a good creepy bit when the statue comes to life  though  props to this scene  not much happens  and the movie just feels sort of scummy  i was happy when it ended  and don t believe anything about this being a true story    very surprised this is averaging around,0,
anyone who has seen the trailer for this film would be forgiven for thinking this film is an out and out comedy  in actual fact it s a light hearted  though not overly funny  romp about a couple of highwaymen   there are numerous faults in the film  the script and plot are weak and the love aspect of the story is strangely dull  yet despite all this it is quite enjoyable  thanks largely to the two leads robert carlyle and jonny lee miller  these two fine actors  carlyle in particular  are always good to watch and here there exists a good chemistry between them   director jake scott is the next generation of the family whose brothers  ridley and tony  have given us films such as alien  blade runner  true romance and more recently g i  jane and enemy of the state  his debut is directed with energy and enthusiasm  which keeps the film fizzling along  although without the strong cast he assembled the results might not have worked as well   in short if you re looking for an easy enjoyable film to pass an hour and a half then you could do a lot worse than plunkett and macleane  if on the other hand you fancy something subtle  historically accurate and thought provoking  go elsewhere,1,
i just had the opportunity to see  nuovomondo   hitherto known in the u s  as  the golden door    and was very impressed by both it s dreamy   occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from sicially to the u s  in the early days of the   th century  it also worked as a  proverbial middle finger jammed into the eyeball of homeland security  preferably all the way up to the  rd knuckle  in it s depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land  the  mostly  italian cast  with a few exceptions works well  this is a quiet understated film that is lovely to look at  the occasional but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure  while the screenplay is well written  this is a film for those who are sick   tired of mindless escapism from hollywood that serves little more than to sell popcorn  not that i have any burning issues with popcorn mind you    i actually love the stuff   you would do wise to seek out nuovomondo the golden door  or whatever it s being titled in your area,1,
the best thing one can say about the film  traffic  is that it brought attention to the superior british mini series  traffik   as many people have noted  the current film suffers from truncating the story to accommodate the short attention span of cinemagoers and the turn around time of the theater owners  who measure a film s success by the overpriced food sales   i first recorded this mini series in      when it was shown on public tv and have watched it many times  the whole documentary style series has a strong element of tragedy and doom about it  as the characters are all moving toward their eventual fate  the strongest of the three tales is that of the pakistani family forced into the city to find a way to keep body and soul together after the poppy crop is burned by the army in a staged show of force put on for the benefit of western politicians  the hardships of the family are similar to that of the rickshaw pullers family in  city of joy   eventually the farmer finds work  but he compromises his pride and honesty   the pakistani segment of the film has a particular relevance to today  with the fight against the supporters of al quaeda  and gives some understanding of the support for such movements among the disadvantaged poor of pakistan and afghanistan who rarely receive any of the money going into those countries  the film makes a point that the farmers see barely     of the aid which is supposed to encourage them to grow other crops   with the american inability to see anything other than in terms of black and white   good guys v  bad guys   it is interesting to see another view where there is no black and white  only shades of grey    possible spoiler ahead  the only problem i had with the story was that rather than things continuing as they did before  as they would in real life  being a work of fiction they had to wrap it up with the  bad guys  getting what was coming to them  other than that  this was a fine piece of work of the kind we see all too rarely  the cast was outstanding and the german and pakistani locations helped give the film a  different  feel  what a change it made seeing germans as something other than the villains in a wwii film,1,
i found this movie to be educational  entertaining and very moving  i was impressed when i learned of just how much justice arbour had contributed in during her time in kosovo   wendy crewson is highly under rated and it is good to see her again in a canadian production  other easily recognizable stars are leslie hope      and john corbett  sex in the city    while the story line of this movie may not be completely factual it did leave me with the desire to learn more about the word of arbour  a great movie for inspiring young women   i say the movie is a  must see,1,
i had actually considered investing in this movie when gorman was out drumming up funding  i loved most of the script but did not like the ending  gorman insisted the ending was as it had to be   seeing the completed movie i have to say i am amazed  reading the script i had not imagined the acting  and gorman s directing  would be as powerful and moving as it is here  the two leads did an amazing job  they were very believable and this movie is well worth watching just for the performances of these two amazing stars   now  for the spoiler and if you have not seen the movie please don t read further as you need to see the movie first   i actually wish i had never read the script just so i could have experienced the movie ending first hand                                   spoiler   i have two main problems with the movie  first off  and i m sure i mentioned this when i read the script  the wife should have died  if she were dead the ending would be much more believable  as it is  we have this guy who has been agonizing over a woman who left him  years ago   if she left him and he is still in love after so long he d have to be seriously delusional  but he doesn t come across that way in the script   there is also the problem of why he did not expend all this energy going after the wife he still loves    plus  if the wife were dead we would actually be able to believe that they had a fulfilling  reciprocating love  and therefore believe that the guy is devastated enough for the ending to be reasonable   however  i don t buy daphne doing what she does in the ending  i d need a heck of a lot of convincing to believe that this naive girl  very naive for a whore but believable due to bohl s performance  did what she did  the character is simply not cold enough  and if she did this out of some kind of love  or something else  then there is a whole piece of the movie story missing   much of this movie is reminiscent of  sex  lies  and video tape   i think it could have been as popular if gorman had chosen to give the movie a more believable ending    so watch the movie  enjoy the performance  and make up your own mind,1,
superbly adapted to the screen and extremely faithful to mary webb s period novel  this film is a true masterpiece  aside from the exceptionally talented rising star  janet mcteer as the lead and one or two established actors  the film used mostly little known names  yet the drama was all the more convincing for that  the social and personal tension is almost tangible and i felt as if the cast were reacting each other s character as though they would have done in real life  i saw that one commentator asked if janet mcteer really had a hare lip  a testimony to just how good was her characterisation  i saw this on tv when it was first shown  taped it  then later the tape was sadly lost  but it remains clear as anything in my mind  if you have any fondness at all for the social period  it s an absolute must see,1,
as most other reviewers seem to agree  this adaptation of  after the funeral  is very good indeed  always one of my favourite poirot stories i was worried that it might be  messed about with   well  it was a little bit but only a little bit and the end the result was thoroughly entertaining  david suchet continues to be well nigh faultless as poirot and  as others have pointed out  the other star of this show is monica dolan who surely could not be bettered as miss gilchrist  i also really enjoyed fiona glasscott who was spot on as the cutting rosamund shane but really  the casting was quite impeccable throughout    one point is knocked off for the adaptors not being able to resist cramming too many revelations into the final fifteen minutes  the business with the will and house deeds was all a bit unnecessary although i didn t mind how they tightened up the structure of the abernethie family  in the book the family tree is really quite complicated   the final moments when the murderer is revealed however are really incredibly well done and i found the very end  when they all leave enderby  quite touching  this is really one of the very best of the poirot series so far,1,
i ve been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early    s  i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft core fluff  a genre i m not particularly interested in  the dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical  making sense  no doubt  only to it s franco italian producers and the plot completely extraneous  what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood  the scenery  the beautiful philippines   soft focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today  it is truly one of my great  guilty pleasures   i was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy  a worthwhile moodpiece,1,
this show is just plain awful  i liked to watch drake and josh  which was great  and before that the amanda show  also funny  but this is just awful  in my opinion watching this felt like watching those     movies from seltzberg  painful and uncleaver  this is about   dumb    kids who make a crappy web show  while stealing the hole ithing  while their retarded brother is making sculptures  he has no life   the cast is crap  megan from drake and josh is carly  ahhhhhh  a ugly b tch is sam and some kid they pulled off the street plays fred  all i saw from this  ugg  are random  jokes  that include the brother making a clay mation film  he also played an arcade game called pac rat  genious   sam and carly being retards on their web show  and fred being a dork  the only episode a saw  cant remember the title  where fred gets bad luck by not forewarding an email i find videos on youtube funnier than this junk  and why the hell do they get youtube jack    fred  get avgn to cancel the show with his potty mouth  just skip this show,0,
dracula      is the epitome of painfully cheesy cinema  from the get go  i assumed i was in for something pretty nasty  with a cast line up that featured casper van dien  erika eleniak  coolio  and tiny lister  what could be expected  well  let s just say that expectations were crushed     if i really start up  i feel like this review will go on for ages  so we re gonna keep this simple  the vampire isn t even named dracula  the space crew is carrying coffins from the carpathian sector of the transylvania system  in his big scene  coolio speaks of the most horrible things ever spoken of in film history  in the year       everyone wears bad clothes by today s standards  they don t have anything more advanced than a modern wheelchair  and they decorate with neon lights that appear stolen from a roller rink   to top it all off    the ending  sweet merciful god  it doesn t deserve to be ruined  it has to be sen to be believed   i ve rated this movie a     and i wish i could give it a zero    yet i feel compelled to make you watch it  what madness is this,0,
chili palmer is tired of doing movies and know wants to do some success in music  being half mafioso half expert negotiator  he wants to rise in the music market  however  know everyone is like him and making the good singer linda moon to record a hit will be harder as expected  the first part is funny and filled with irony  this one falls into the easy jokes and has many less good moments  only the two women  uma and milian  are decent in their part  most of the film is done with histrionic character  excessively exaggerated  a little is ok  too much is disgusting  and the only one that one could save is the gay bodyguard  who  at least is coherent  the rest  are too much idiot  the most surprising thing is the fact that the movie is not boring  everything happens so quick and there are so many things happening that you do not have time to get bored  if you want to follow the movie  it may insult your intelligence  a lot    and the movie is bad yeah    but  well  it s not boring,0,
there s nothing to say except i want my time back that this movie took from me  i m not racist against latinos  hell  i m half brazilian  i loved the movie kids  it doesn t make any sense  these kids just go around and do nothing  they re not even good at skating  the whole time i m just waiting for something  anything  to happen  but it doesn t  nothing happens the whole movie  did i mention they suck at skating  i might make a movie called beat up rockers  and the whole premise will be about kicking the sh t out of poser moron punks like these kids  i m not even going to get into it  this movie sucks  please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come in contact with it so some other poor soul won t make the same mistake,0,
i ve just watched this again on the bbc channel    it s not jane austen s best novel by any means but the film is a reasonable interpretation  i suspect the assembly rooms at bath would have been rather more crowded than shown  perhaps they couldn t afford the extras  also why does everyone shut up so that the dancing couple can have an audible conversation  i ve never heard anything anyone has ever said to me when i ve been dancing and i suspect it would have been the same in the      th century in bath   i cannot believe the us canada reviews  they completely miss the ironic element that is in the film throughout  the  gothic  scenes are quite cleverly presented but you need to read them properly  i m sure jane a would be mildly amused by those reviews  a propos of nothing  does anyone else think that peter firth gets to look more like colin baker  a former doctor who  or vice versa the older they both get,1,
i saw this version of hamlet on television many years ago  and have seen every other version since  whether television or movie  however  this is the one that remains the truest depiction of the story for me  most excellent derek jacobi made hamlet  real  for me  before i saw this version  shakespeare was simply gibberish to me and i never tried to understand the elizabethan english  having seen jacobi s hamlet several times not only increased my knowledge of literature  but also that of my family  i promptly checked the play out of library and read it  and poured over the accompanying recording  jacobi s rendition attracted me to a deeper knowledge  and yet  i have been searing for a video of it for years and years to no avail  it gets a very high rating from viewers  why  then  has it not been released on video  it s the only hamlet that i d invest in,1,
very cliched  quite corny  acting gets worse as the show goes on  don t believe anything that folks say about the  realism  that this movie is supposed to portray  it s just a shoot em up  interesting twist in that the vc sieging the base were given a human face and weren t portrayed as evil incarnate,0,
this movie beats everything out there  well  depends on what you are looking for    it could be a    or a   on the scale  this movie is in a complete league of its own   i don t think any movie could possibly come close to it  i am not sure what the director intended to make it as   a thriller or a comedy  if he did think he was making a thriller  then he has by a stroke of luck  created one of the best bollywood comedies of all time  you have to see it to believe it   a matrix   terminator   a host of other movies rolled into one  along with a storyline dating back to      s hindi movies  with a icchadhari naag  a mythical snake which can turn into a human    its an ideal movie if you are sitting with a bunch of friends with alcohol on the side  planning to laugh at the movie  i am not sure whether to give it a   or a      on the basis of flipping a coin  i have decided to give it a,0,
michael dudikoff stars as joe armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the u s army  in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless martial arts actioner  which is hampered by too many long pauses without action  but helped by some high energy action setpieces as well as steve james  performance,0,
angel a is a change of pace for besson  monochrome  mawkish and rather mediocre  it is well photographed on location in paris  although subtitle readers should note  quick fire dialogue and good cinematography may make for frustrating viewing   this film is no  wings of desire  or  wonderful life   despite its shared themes  heavenly intervention averts suicide  angel mortal relationships ensue   besson does nothing to enlighten or inspire us  even the well acted  teary moments  rapidly descend into toe curling sentimentality   the film s flawed ideology irritates  an angel whose message of love and respect for self is constantly undermined by her own violent and promiscuous behaviour  a  happy ending  which negates the hero s supposed journey from helplessness to self esteem and independence   verdict  quite nice to look at but confused moral and philosophical messages tarnish the film precisely where it should shine,0,
mishima  a life in four chapters is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative ease  it is based on the life of controversial japanese author yukio mishima  who committed suicide in the     s  it is not really a biopic   at least not one in the traditional sense   but an exploration of mishima s iconoclastic oeuvre  the film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an unembroidered  totally engaging manner  paul schrader makes you sympathize with mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work  it doesn t quite solve the puzzle but it does make you understand it  an added bonus  as we see mishima s fury over the lack of tradition in a morally vacant modern society  schrader gives us an excellent demonstration of the dichotomy between thought and execution in cinema  john bailey s cinematography is spectacularly good  the grandiosity of composer philip glass  work is perfectly suited for the project   mishima  is the best film i ve seen this year  so far,1,
we watched this movie in my chemistry class  so obviously it had educational value  i thought the film did a really good job of intertwining the subjects of the science  moral issues and personal experiences of the manhattan project  but wasn t exactly focused on strong acting  i would recommend this movie for the scientifically inclined or those interested in the moral issues behind fat man and little boy  but if the subject of nuclear bombs bores you  don t see it,1,
the movie was fantastic  if your a fan of bams  cky videos  jackass  or his show viva la bam  you cant help but like it  i have a few friends who aren t fans that enjoyed it  and others who thought it wasn t that great  those who didn t like it were mostly female friends  they really didn t appreciate some of the crude humor  that personally i think made the movie so funny  i m pretty sure the entire movie was filmed in bams home town  which includes a lot of his regularly visited locations  the cast of is made up of all his friends and cky buddies  and also includes some big name pro skateboarders too  the soundtrack is phenomenal  with music by him  in my opinion  haggard has it all  a great plot  characters you ll never see anywhere else  plenty of humor great music and a cast that was dedicated to the project,1,
the patriot staring steven segal is a late    s thriller action movie that is not really a thriller and not really an action movie  rather it is steven segal playing steven segal by another name  but this time he is a native american country doctor who kicks butt every now an again  baring the obvious plot line holes  the movie itself is absolutely amazing in terms of the blatant disregard for character devolvement    from a marketing standpoint  i was left asking myself   who in the world were they aiming at   the bio thriller plot line is way off the mark for the middle america crowd and segal as silk cowboy would never sell to anyone even if you deep fried him and put him between a kripsy cream donut  the whole movie is just way out there  even for segal fans  because it simply does not deliver on any level,0,
this was truly a deeply moving movie in every sense of the word  i myself was a mormon missionary and i know first hand the wanting to complete my mission but at the same time hiding the fact that i was gay  like the character aaron  i was sent home for being found out and excommunicated  but being the only mormon in a family of catholics wasn t as big a shame as it was for the lead character  this movie really took me back to those days and helped me to realize  years later  how fortunate i was to have a family that accepted me and understood what i was going through  i found myself applauding the end of a movie when aaron and christian find each other again by shear chance at lila s restaurant  i was truly moved to tears  i highly recommend this movie to all who read this review and also declare it a must buy,1,
i love camp movies  believe me and the usual technicolorian gore of gordon lewis don t bother me at all  but this is just one of his most stupid movies  even more than blood feast  i m not kidding  the gore gore girls is about a mad person who kills a lot of go re    go re  girls of a night club  a detective and a reporter tries to find out the big secret  maybe the performances here are slightly better than the usual average acting h g lewis films  but that is not saying much  the camera work is even dreadful   but at least is kind of watchable with the go go girls acting     you going to pass a good time with it  and the killings are just absurd in a very  very bad way  a girl is killed with a wooden hammer punching in her butt     and just don t let me talk about what it does with the nipples  you going to laugh like anyone with this  but the better of all this mess is a scene that i only love of it s campness  the go go girl before being attacked by a lot of feminists dancing in a very american way  though is important to note that this was one of the first films that got an x rating because of it s violence   only if you want lo laugh and pass a good time  but only with a lot  a lot of beers,0,
well  of course the critics hated it  this isn t a movie that s going for the big time critical acclaim  but the fact is that it s really very good   sure  if you don t like that chris farley brand of physical comedy  or the exceedingly dry wit of david spade  you re not going to like it  but for the rest of us  the movie has many hilarious  and for that matter quotable  sequences  and the plot isn t half as dumb as that of  black sheep   the parts that aren t meant to be humorous are actually done well  not what you d expect from a movie of this ilk  and the acting is really pretty good    tommy boy  is without question chris farley s best movie  i give it an a and suggest you give it a view,1,
this film was great tangi miller and flex did a great job  they both look good together and they both pulled it off tasha smith was so funny as the cousin and she couldn t stay out of her business essence held it down for her girl  when she needed her  aloma was sweet and played a dear grandmother she really reminded me of my grandmother and oh i can t forget about the stripper  he was so find  and i didn t know if i should cover my eyes or smile while i watch him reveal his sexiness on the big screen damn  he was fine  tangi looked flawless  and sexy  and she stepped up a notch since felicity  over all the movie had a lot  a  list actors and actress  it was funny  sexy  crazy  touching loving  emotional and wonderful  this movie is a must see  go it get on dvd now if don t have it,1,
first off i am in my mid    s  been watchin horror films since i was a kid so i have seen a lot of variety  imo this is not as bad as the multitudes that gave this a   or      yes it is a low budget horror flick  the dialog is soso and acting tolerable sometimes  the basis of this film plotwise is actually pretty good  for those of you old enough to remember or lucky enough to have seen them on dvd  this is very much like a      s movie of the week  just add in blood and minor gore minor t   a and swearing  without big names  that is it to a t  i would rather watch this than jason vs godzilla or whatever other continuois crap is out there  tho not as good  evil dead was a low budget film  at least give these guys credit for trying  with acouple mil budget this could have been a pretty good flick  my score a watchable,0,
it was libby talking to desmond in the flashback  and if anyone is confused about her past  like how did she end up in the same hospital hurley was in  then you should know that despited libby dying in season    the character will be explored more in season   and we will get answers to questions surrounding her   btw  great episode  it had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions   like what happened to eko and lock and what about the four toe statue   i cannot wait till season    lost just rules    i hope all the unanswered questions will be answered  i loved how they explained why the plane actually crashed  desmond did it when he did not manage to type in the numbers in time,1,
i knew this was headed for disaster after looking at the clock within   minutes of air time  the story line  two people get married  they move into the wife s parents home  and husband doesn t get along with father in law and if you haven t seen this plot before you probably have not watched tv for the last    years or so,0,
oh  well i thought it should be a good action  but it was not  although jeff speakman stars there is nothing to watch only two fight for almost     hours  yak a lot of talking and everything is so artificial that you could not believe it  the plot is clear from the beginning  if you want good action don t rent this movie,0,
dead man s bounty  the film s american title  has the look and feel of a classic italian western  the cinematography  costumes  and sets look great  the cast is rugged  not a pretty face among them  at the beginning i was preparing for a pretty cool movie but what i eventually witnessed was an absolute disaster   the script was perfectly dreadful  there was no suspense whatsoever and very little action or worthwhile drama   despite looking great  the cast spoke  english  with heavy european accents that were often unintelligible   the final nail in it s coffin was the broad streak of pretentiousness that paints most of the picture  focusing heavily on the character of the barmaid who s featured in a couple of very awkward sex scenes  also her speech near the end was pretty repugnant   the only novelty comes from the stunt casting of val kilmer in the role of the dead man  continuing his recent string of doa performances,0,
yul brynner was a symbol of villein in the tine of    s   he play a role of russian leader in hungary at the time of revolution in this country in      that made it against the marxism   the script of this film made it by good taste from the writer that mixing love and adventure with showing different characters in the journey from hungary to england   the best point in this film was the symbol of challenge from the hungarian resistance to kill the russian major yul brynner  in the hall time of the film that made a meaning about the disadvantages of this major from his bad works   but at the end he made a good work to help deborah kerr for escaping her and her darling to london to write in his book a good working to gain at the end people s agreement and trustment after his assassination by the hungarian resistance,1,
i m not sure what the appeal of this movie is  but i couldn t find it  it s a really long  barely credible  hardly lucid conversation between three guys on one set    it doesn t move anywhere  the characters are just totally bizarre  the underlying plot equally so  it s lost on me  definitely a walk out movie   the one thing that keeps you from walking out is the ever unrealized possibility that it might have some kind of point or meaningful climax  and the fact that  all irritation aside at the banal personalities  they re acted quite reasonably  but you have to brace yourself for endless dialog  wishing on many an occasion that teach would just shut the      up for a moment,0,
this french film is supposedly about a creepy  dim witted cop who investigates the rape and murder of a young girl in a small town  however  the film is really about nothing and it takes forever to say nothing  if it takes a character ten minutes to walk from point a to point b  the film spends ten minutes showing this walk  and these are the  action  scenes  there are also static shots that last for minutes  making the viewer wonder if he accidentally hit the pause button on the remote  the script has enough material for a    minute movie  the movie lasts seven hours or so  you do the math  the actors were apparently amateurs and it shows  note to self  never see a dumont movie again,0,
every time i watch this show i just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week  the dialogs  or monologues rather  as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing  are just becoming so tedious  for example  the episode i watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish  i forgot what it was  pasta with meatballs perhaps  always manages to turn the gilmore family dinner into all out war  and these were just the few seconds or so   so it seems every time  lots of lines  with absolutely zero content  the scripts they use must be enormous   but then every once in a while something happens  the babbling stops and suddenly there are these wonderful silent  emotional moments  for example  this week it was lorelai s breakdown at the estate agent s  i just thought it was the best piece of tv i have seen for a long while   almost makes everything worthwhile,1,
i cannot believe someone gave this movie a   rating    and it is only a    average    what is not to love about this film  it is original  it has lots of scare scenes that actually made me jump out of my seat  and it has some great special effects  the story is fresh  there is some nudity  and it is very campy  the killer was scary in his own demented way and the end is very unexpected  i must admit that i really love this film  one of spain s best horror films ever  if you consider yourself a true horror fan you need to get out there and try to find this film  you will be pleasantly surprised to do so,1,
earnest effort which achieves some success to adapt the classic odyssey story to a     s nostalgia period piece  the adventurers this time are escaped convicts  wandering about the depression afflicted south bungling their way into trouble   the greatest strength of the film is the wonderful music soundtrack  effectively evoking not only the era that this is set in  but the spiritual references that run rampant in the film  besides its value to the tone of the movie  the music is just plain fun to listen to   what cripples the film is that the characters really aren t that likable  in a comedy  you need that element in order to have fun along with them in their misadventures  instead  we have a bunch of selfish  arrogant  soulless  mean spirited nobodies who really have no positive points at all  they re not imposing enough to make you hate them either  so it s hard to relate to them at all  they re offered up as clowns  but like people who put clown makeup on and march in parades  they just aren t funny   like the story that inspired it  the movie takes these guys on an  odyssey   encountering a variety of symbolic  some even mystical  characters  everybody is stamped with offensive stereotypes  the operative word being  stupid   people are mocked right and left  and consequently  no one is left being particularly interesting or appealing  the movie doesn t like its own characters  and it doesn t let you like them  either   riverside baptisms  beautiful sirens  stolen cars  fistfights  radio preachers  people being whipped with sticks  all are thrown at you in disjointed fashion  some evoke a few laughs  others confuse or bore you  i did laugh when a nerdy guy beat the snot out of an especially obnoxious lead character  but there were a lot more pointlessly gratuitous scenes  an example  some     s dillinger type guy strafes cows with a tommy gun  comedy  symbolism  no  just mindless violence  which detracts from the intellectual nature of the original source material this story draws upon   other adaptations of the odyssey are much better  unless you re a george clooney fan  rent something else  but buy the soundtrack cd  the music is great,0,
this film is definitely up there with the worst films i ve ever seen  probably in my top   of worst films  i laughed once and that was when   evan   im building something  evan s secretary   i hope its a barber shop   that was literally the only time i laughed in this  comedy   awful compared to bruce almighty which as a big jim carrey fan   wasn t even that great    this movie lacked the humour of having god s powers and was more about family bonding  id class it solely as a family movie  definitely not a family comedy    seeing a bird poo on someone s shirt is not hilarious  neither is a beard that grows back instant   i didn t even think the special effects were great  the animals looked really stuck on  it was like watching a film which hadn t been  glued  together properly       film   avoid,0,
this has some of the stupidest fight scenes of all time  if i was a veteran of any war i would cry when i see this movie  not because i would remember being in vietnam  but because it is a poor representation of any veteran of that war  even though the troops are carrying m  s  that movie resembles nothing like vietnam  the viet cong even uniforms look like old leftover japanese uniforms from a wwii movie  the setting is obviously some crappy hollywood back lot  the worst scene contains a us soldier fighting  hand to hand  like in a bad martial arts movie  after he dispatches several enemy troops he says   hey come down here and lets kick some butt   to a helicopter in the air  he then is shot  this movie is trash,0,
i went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night  i m    years old and this movie was way too much for me  i couldn t imagine taking a teenager  preteen  or  especially  a child to this movie  it was crude and offensive  i was totally misled by its pg    rating and the previews that i had seen for it  i had originally seen previews for it on nickelodeon  and i thought that it looked pretty cute  maybe i just don t remember the preview correctly    plus  drake bell  the movie s main character  stars on a nickelodeon television show that targets preteens and young teenagers  i really didn t think that the movie s content would be as risky as it was  i should have done more research about it before i went  however  i m hoping that parents will read up on this movie before they take their kids to see it just because it has drake bell in it   seriously  do not take your kids or teenagers to see this movie  the rating should have been r  there are tons of sexual references  drug references  and disturbing events throughout the movie  examples  drake bell gets attacked by sexually charged animals  several scenes that involve men grabbing women s breasts  lots of profanity  drake bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla frosting  or something like that   people get stabbed  hit  and hurt in the movie  and an elderly lady and her dog get shredded  there are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie  it was really demeaning to women in general  the movie is by the people that made the scary movie series  so that should tell you something right there  please remember that seeing movies like this can give kids and teenagers all kinds of wrong ideas about sex  drugs  and violence  most children and teenagers can t decipher between spoofs or comedy and reality   i do have a sense of humor  i also know that the humor that was in this film is typical of its genre  but i find the possibility of children and teenagers going to see this movie horrifying   as for the overall quality of the movie  i didn t think it was that original or funny  it dragged in parts and some of the humor was just forced and painful  the acting wasn t too bad  considering how bad the script was  if you re an adult or older teen looking for a funny movie  skip this one or rent it,0,
this is the worst movie i have ever seen and believe me i ve sen a lot of bad movies  i love cheeesy horror but this was just terrible  there was not one scene in this film where i felt scared  all the actors must have been people that they found at a bus stop    minutes prior to shooting  i wish that blockbutser would have given me my    cents back  the acting was terrible  the writing was incredibly bad  someone had to screen this movie before it was released and had to know that it was terrible  i d be embarrassed to have my name associated with this monstrosity  don t rent this movie  if you do  don t return it so no other poor souls will ever make the mistake of renting it,0,
i am ashamed to admit in public that i even held the cover of this movie once  this is an absolute reason why one should research on the movie before seeing it  the  makers  of this movie have called us all fools and gullible losers with too much time on our hands   based on the mythical indian shape shifting powerful cobras and rebirth  the story takes us for a painful ride  college going     actors  now really   are the target of their former friend manisha koirala  who was in her former life a cobra  but is now a ghost   and her pathetic  eternal  powerful boyfriend cobra killing machine boyfriend munish kohli  who thankfully hasn t been seen since   now do you need to know more   i vote for studying for the upcoming test in school rather than this movie  give it a pass if you are sane  if not    then you ll probably enjoy it,0,
the world may never know   the film that did take the  best animated short  oscar that year   anna and bella   is very good  but it s no  big snit   both are available on expanded entertainment s  world s greatest animation  compilation  in case you d like to compare     snit  and its director  richard condie  have attracted so much attention that there s little for me to add  i d like to note  however  that the film contains one of my very favorite single  shots  in an animated short  the one where the man opens the door to let the cat out  i don t want to give away the actual events depicted here  but the first time i saw the shot i was whipsawed from one mood to another  then seconds later to still another  that shot has never failed to affect me that way since  for this shot  and for the way condie builds up to that set of moments   the big snit  deserves the tag of  masterpiece,1,
loved today s show    it was a variety and not solely cooking  which would have been great too   very stimulating and captivating  always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next  she is as down to earth and as personable as you get  like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable  special guests  who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too  loved the  first  theme and that the audience was invited to play along too  i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things  but she did it and by golly i ll be writing those recipes down  saving time in the kitchen means more time with family  those who haven t tuned in yet  find out what channel and the time  i assure you that you won t be disappointed,1,
at the beginning of this film  which i found myself watching on ifc in the wee hours of the morning  i was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort  the feeling of being trapped with no way to escape was so powerful that i didn t know if i wanted to continue watching   although it didn t really seem to me that i had much of a choice  so compelling was the situation   gradually  though  that feeling of discomfort waned  although it never really disappeared entirely   and i felt drawn into tessa   bobby s predicaments  and really just hoping against hope that they might get back together   really just a moving  powerful story fit snugly into a tiny package  i had no idea that sarah polley had anything to do with it until perusing her trivia  so now i love it even more   i definitely recommend it     if your lucky enough to catch it on the independent film channel sometime  or wily enough to figure out some other way to view it,1,
if you can make it through this flick without laughing out loud at the screen  you are a better filmgoer than i   count the logic lapses  common sense leaps  and credibility stretches    betcha need more than two hands   p s   if one more film uses a location that is clearly ucla  and claims that it is a different university  in this movie s case  berkeley   i m going to lose it,0,
bam margera of the jackass fame is back with his own reality show  and not only is it not as funny as jackass  but it s also amazingly stupider  this has to be one of the dumbest shows ever conceived  sure there are worse reality shows but none are as mean spirited or as dumb   bam margera has made it big  and his parents decided to piggy bank off of his fame  bam and his parents  his uncle  his crew of idiotic friends all live together  and while bam and his buddies are off breaking things and getting into mischief  generally his parents are at home being stupid  when bam s parents aren t at home being lazy  they re being tortured by bam  especially his father  to add to the humor  we are treated to his fat uncle don vitto who is constantly out of it  and never paying attention   this show really is like a toned down version of jackass   toned down in that there aren t stunts  instead bam and his buddies just go break stuff  and do lame stunts  and meanwhile loud music plays to make it all the more awesome  this is not funny in the least  i can t imagine a dumber show than this because there is not an ounce of intelligence found here   if you are a big fan of bam margera  and want to see one of the many follow up cash in sequels to the jackass series   my rating    out of          mins  tv,0,
i am very surprised to see the good ratings for this movie   i watched the film   years ago and i still remember how angry i felt to sit in the movie theatre and to look at this mess  i am a big fan of john boorman s work  i really like his movies  so i went to  beyond rangoon  with big expectations  but i felt like watching a dumb  cheap chuck norris jungle movie with all action scenes cut out  even the soundtrack was very annoying   i can t believe that john boorman was the director because this movie was so badly done  i think the burmese people deserve better films to illustrate their struggle,0,
american made final entry in the  blood island  series of filipino horror films concerns abdul amir  reed hadley   ruler of a fictional country  he dies of cancer  yet it s figured out how to bring him back  put his brain into a donor body  the mad doctor in charge  kent taylor  puts it in a highly unlikely body  the facially scarred giant manservant named gor  john bloom   a doctor friend of the ruler tries to remedy matters and put an end to the mad doctors  plans   film making partners samuel m  sherman  producer  and al adamson  director  corral several actors they ve worked with before  including taylor  adamsons  sexy wife regina carrol  angelo rossitto  zandor vorkov  and vicki volante  they tried to go for the feel of the previous  blood island  entries but one can tell this was made stateside  while not necessarily a  good  film  it s got a bunch of amusing elements to add up to an entertainingly trashy whole  a malevolent dwarf  rossitto   gory operations  a rather unconvincing makeup job on bloom  the political intrigue subplot  caverns full of cobwebs  etc  the narrative is actually pretty coherent  with plot twists thrown in here and there  i think it could have been trimmed a bit  some scenes drag  but it s got its fun moments and an ending people might not expect   for this kind of thing  the acting isn t too bad  both taylor and rossitto are fun  the latter seems to be having quite a good time in his role  volante is appealing enough  and williams is o k  in the heroic role  in any event  it s nice to see all of these familiar faces in one of these films   absolutely nothing special  but as a trashy b  horror   i use the word loosely  none of this is exactly scary  film  it certainly amuses,1,
once a year in america  saturday morning would give way to new cartoons  usually sometime in america  just about the time school started   i guess this was to make not having school on saturdays that more bearable   one friday night before the premiere of the new saturday morning cartoons  a movie came on    at the earth s core  i had not a clue who cushing nor mcclure were  clearly they were not from the same country  so i couldn t grasp why they were traveling together   i do recall seeing the mechanism in the fire breathing monster s mouth   what connects this movie for me is the opening with the molten metal and then suddenly we get the band playing as we see the factory   how do you end a movie like this  the music again  and two bewlidered cops as the drill appears behind them   whatever reason  i remember watching this movie more that friday night than i do any new cartoon that came on the following morning   that was definitely the late seventies   it would be during jurassic park mania  cicra      i believe  before i would see this movie again   yes  people in costumes  there was the fire breather again   still loved the ending with the two cops   finally  it would be nearly another decade before i would send off for the movie on dvd   now i would just watch the beginning and intro   oh  i do love much of the movie  of all these sci fi jules verne  hg wells  erb movies  this one stands as my fave   what i note now is that one of the cops begins turning around a wee bit too soon  then turns back  then he and the other cop are synchronized as they turn inward once again to look behind themselves at the drill   perhaps for me  this movie stands as the best of the saturday morning shows  which is why i enjoy it so much,1,
another raquel welch classic  this picture hit the theaters november         starring raquel welch as michele  james stacey as joe and luke askew as alan morris  nikki is on her way to meet with her girl friends michele and jackie  while on her way there  she runs into her ex husband who wants a second chance  nikki walk away from him goes to the table where she sees michele and jackie  alan approaches her again and she starts to walk away when alan shoots her in the back  nikki is taken to the hospital while michele and jackie go to the police station  michele goes to the hospital where she meets up with jackie only to find that nikki died  alan then goes after jackie who he hits with a car and then tries to run michele down  michele jumps into her car and heads for los angeles  when she gets there  she calls lloyd her boss in las vegas to let him know that she was all right  lloyd tells her to go to the club called the losers to see jeri about a job  however  there s one problem  the bartender has a drug problem and alan knows it so alan and the bartender have a little talk  back in los angeles michele not only gets a job as a dancer with jeri but also hooks up with jeri bouncer joe  now some thoughts on this picture  this picture was far better then raquel last  and this one had nonstop action  luke askew did a fine job of playing nikki ex husband  he was your typical murder with the look that goes with it  as for raquel welch performance  the only word that comes to mine is fantastic  she was awesome in this movie and her beauty stood out and shined like never before  the outfit that she wore on stage to dance was breathtaking  in fact  all the outfits she wore in this movie were breathtaking  of course  it doesn t matter what raquel had on because she looks good in everything or nothing  i give this movie    weasel stars for two reasons  the first and by far is raquel welch who s the leading actress and deserves    stars  the second reason is that this movie was wall to wall excitement from beginning to end,1,
as i m listening to my parents watch this  after i gave up    minutes into the film   they have absolutely no idea what is going on  when  charles dickens  stared into the camera  i half expected him to turn into a demon  yes  he looked like one   unfortunately  that didn t happen   this movie had various reasons i did not finish it  one  it was unbearably slow  i mean  seriously  it was sloww  you can only understand     of what is said  and the characters were poorly introduced   if you have an english accent and you like a lottt of talking  no action  terrible acting  cheesy laughs  and the same music sound effects played over and over and over  then this is the movie for you            completely horrible   avoid at all costs,0,
you don t have to be a fan of the cartoon show to enjoy this film  i watched it for the first time when i was nine  having been a fan of the t v show  and my parents laughed just as hard as i did  it is done in the classic style of bugs bunny cartoons from yesterday  and considering todays vulgar cartoons  i would think anybody would appreciate a cartoon movie that relies more on  wackiness  then on vulgarity  to get a few laughs,1,
written by someone who has been there  you can tell  but only if you ve been there  excellent performances by meryl streep  of course    renee zellweger and william hurt   many people have said that it is about a dysfunctional family  i think every family is dysfunctional when they are facing this kind of torment  to not be dysfunctional would be dysfunctional  you are losing your family as you know it  can anything be worse  people need to see this movie so when they are faced with this nightmare maybe they will change how they do it  maybe they will see that the father is denying himself valuable time he ll never get a chance at again  maybe they will realize how hard it is to die  or to watch someone you love die  they didn t miss much of the nightmare  it s hard to forget,1,
i am really amazed how little fame this film had  i think it has to do with distribution companies and etc   don t be idiots   if you are looking for a good fun take this movie   this is very nice movie to pass few hours with and the music is great   it s about       well girls and boys and whats between them with not too much story but not all movies should be pulp fiction should they   it s nice and cute and gives good time   the girls are also very good looking and this makes the whole movie even more enjoyable   why i gave it only a    well the story could be little more convincing from the middle and on  in some point you start to see events that are little less reliable  small spoiler  the baby is crying and the father goes in and tries to relax him  now i am not talking about some small cry but  no   hysteric cry and    sec after that the father goes out and  baby is sleeping   excuse me   when and how exactly did you make him calm and sleep and be able to leave his room in       seconds  but ignore this kind of small picking because the film itself is not docudrama   it s fun and this should be overlooked,1,
this movie has two new features in relation to the message conveyed by other equally good movies about death penalty and executions  those are the stress also given to the drama endured by victims  parents    without for that reason disguising the hatred and desire of revenge they feel or lessening the horror that execution represents    and the christian vision of all the questions implied  we must also point out that in this movie the sentenced man is not the usual nice innocent person we see in other movies dealing with executions which doesn t lead us to abandon the idea that a penal execution is no more than a legal murder anyway  last but not least we must mention the extraordinary emotional weight put on the last moments of the execution course with all the catharsis shown by the convicted s last words and the detail with which the act of the execution itself is viewed in a parallel cut with images of the murder scenes in the forest to stress that we are being confronted with another murder so pitiless as the latter but performed in a cold and supposed  legal  way,1,
rented this one by mistake thinking it was another film with the same title  and realizing that i had rented it some time before   quick plot line  a couple consisting of an artist and photographer rent a studio apartment in los angeles from joe estevez  still cursing the fact his brother martin sheen could actually act  they find a bed in a forgotten room  but the bed is haunted by a nasty looking serial killer from the      s and his last victim  their ghosts inhabit the couple  first enhancing their sex life  but eventually becoming more menacing   what ensues is cheap r rated sex scenes  cheaper thrills and kind of a waste of time,0,
beware my lovely originated from a play written by mel dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women  his first and best effort was the screenplay for the spiral staircase  he also did a loretta young suspense thriller cause for alarm a couple of years earlier  the play dinelli wrote was originally entitled the man and it ran for    performances on broadway during the      season  it was dinelli s only effort on broadway and it starred dorothy gish and richard boone    the roles that gish and boone played are taken by ida lupino and robert ryan  for whatever reason rko thought to eliminate the age difference  dinelli himself rewrote his play for the screen so i m wondering what he thought about that  certainly the frailty issue was eliminated completely from the story   that wasn t the only thing that was eliminated  the people are all wearing period clothing from around world war i yet there s no reference at all to the time this story takes place in  i thought that strange and later on when the telephone company repairman comes to ida lupino s residence  i noticed his truck was a vintage one of the same era   the film is almost entirely set within ida lupino s home where she s hired an itinerant stranger in robert ryan as a handyman  the film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference  it turns out that ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons lupino in her home for about a day   both the leads do fine jobs even with the changes made  films like beware my lovely are the stuff that a small studio like rko did best  if this were done at mgm or paramount the glossy trappings would have overwhelmed a solid story,1,
how important is the director  anyway  in this film  made in the politically tumultuous times of the late   s where questions of social organization were prime conflicts  asks that question by making a movie that turns the camera away from the action and only begs to reveal the director  william greaves  it is an important work  as it shows like no other movie shows the difficulties in blocking  organizing  and setting the scene  it reveals the role of the crew  something most directors frankly would like to disappear completely and that the invisibility of is essential for suspending disbelief  and it also puts into consideration the role of performance and scripting and how they match don t match reality and what that has to say about how the director ultimately influences reality  if at all    the documentary  or pseudo documentary  or fictional narrative  whichever you prefer  via your interpretations of the themes  has its brain in the over educated  over intellectual crew  its guts in the lost performers struggling to understand the vague and ambiguous directions  and its heart in the director  who stands in as the desire to portray  to represent  to express without any idea how to do any of those things or why he wants to do it  it s a film that purposefully repeats banalities just to see if they can become more than banalities  it s a film that sometimes shows the multiple shots simultaneously  just to leave the editing to the audience and also reveal how disturbingly different shots change perspective   it s an important work  and something that everyone interested in the industry and process of film making should watch and understand  it  like many experimental films  has no real mass audience appeal  it s not for them  it s for the industry  and its for the   s  asking what to do with a group effort medium that still relies on a single  voice  and  author      polarisdib,1,
there were at least a half dozen silent film versions of shakespeare s  the merchant of venice   and there have been several television productions  but no one has ever gotten around to making a big budget theatrical feature from the play       until now  given the nature of the play s most memorable character  shylock the nasty jew  it s a good guess that the little unpleasantness that transpired in europe in the late      s and      s may have dampened filmmakers  enthusiasm  sure the main motivation for michael radford s new film is to provide al pacino with a chance to shout  bray  brood  mutter  and be tormented   all of which he is quite good at  like richard iii  the role of shylock is a scenery chewer s dream  it is ridiculous to call shakespeare an anti semite  since he never met a jew  jews were banned from england from     years before his time to some decades after his death  and its unlikely that he ever traveled abroad  on some level  jews might as well have been a mythological race to him  but  while shakespeare may not have been anti semitic  his play certainly is  pacino gives shylock a strange accent that is probably meant to suggest the slightest hint of yiddish  unfortunately  the result is a   th century moneylender with the unmistakable diction and cadences of fozzie bear  radford s version begins with a crawl about the wretched teratment of jews and then spot antonio  jeremy irons  gratuitiously spitting on shylock  pacino   who s really just standing around  minding his own business  will buy it when it comes out on dvd  for sure  sarge booker,1,
what are forest whitaker and clifton collins jr  doing in this  light it up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece on problems in low income area schools  while the topic is one that needs to be addressed  the film uses every cliche in the genre and comes off as a textbook popcorn flick  the characters are cutouts from the inner city version of the breakfast club or even the faculty  watch this with your children when they turn    or     with them  it could be an outlet for a lesson on current social problems  for anyone older  it will be nothing more than something to watch and spit on at   in the morning  as i did recently on bravo  matter of fact  what was this doing on bravo,0,
val kilmer is almost nowhere in this film  lucky for him  he plays maybe    seconds of screen time and his role is completely irrelevant  after seeing the film i couldn t tell you what  role  he plays in the film     ok    they suck you in the first hour by immersing you in dark underground tunnels  spooky movies filmed in dark underground tunnels easily suck most people in to last the first    minutes to an hour  then you will begin wondering   why am i watching this   i remember thinking how easy it must be for a director writer to use dark underground labyrinths to make a film  simply film people wandering around in dark tunnels and you have instant  suspense   but that is where this movie goes no further  we all wonder what goes bump in the night  but there is nothing out there in the dark in this film but more darkness  the story is even worse  apparently there is an underlying story to the film that i learned of  after  watching the film  but the film uses such poor dialouge that it never came across clearly during the screening  i still don t understand what the writer director meant to say  some children trapped underground by a misled sister in russia  why  are they in our time  the same time as the characters  are they ghosts    this was an absolutely horrible film that drew me to write my first imdb review to warn others to avoid it,0,
this movie was a major bait and switch  i rented it because of rebecca st  james  a popular christian singer  i have met her and wondered what she would be doing in a ufo movie  well         i think that she starred in this movie to help out a friend  or a friend of a friend  my first clue that this movie wasn t what it was supposed to be was when i witnessed the special effects of the ufo encounters  cheesy  as the movie progressed  i noticed how plastic the actors were  it was funny how almost everyone in the movie wore solid colors   there are a few exceptions    rebecca was verrryyy disappointing  she is always found in the house and doesn t show the realistic facial expressions of one whose husband has return to the fold  doesn t she ever leave the house    i had to turn off the movie several times in order to finish it  i hope that rebecca doesn t believe the message of this movie   believe in what we believe or suffer and go to hell  jesus spread a message of love and hope  his message inspired others to change out of love  not fear,0,
this film is not at all as bad as some people on here are saying  i think it has got a decent horror plot and the acting seem normal to me  people are way over exagerating what was wrong with this  it is simply classic horror  the type without a plot that we have to think about forever and forever  we can just sit back  relax  and be scared,1,
this is not a new film  it is a re cut of      s  emmanuelle  queen of the galaxy   and it has been significantly truncated  warning  many characters appear in the credits that have been cut from the movie   if you want to see this one in its original form  pick up  queen    avoid this one at all costs  as the cuts make it even choppier than it was originally,0,
this movie needs to come out on dvd cause that s the only way i will buy it  i thought it was soo funny because there was no real plot to it  it was not suppose to be an oscar winning film  i appreciate those films  cary elwes was a very cute robin hood  i can t even think of my favorite part of the movie because they are all pretty good  anyways peace out,1,
adam sandler s movies are my favorite comedies  the silence of the lambs is my favorite horror movie  the matrix is my favorite sci fi movie  anywhere but here is my favorite drama   perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie has is it s acting   susan sarandon is absolutely amazing  by the end of this movie i felt as if i knew her character better than i knew myself  she did a simply amazing job   natalie portman also did a great job  i recently rented her first movie  leon         in which she played a    year old girl  i believe that she is a contradiction in terms  she was a good kid actress  well    years later she is still just as good an actress  in fact  she s much better   not only did sarandon and portman portray their characters well  but they also worked perfectly together  i mean  even now i can hardly believe that they are not actually mother and daughter in real life as well as in this movie   this movie is about a    year old girl  portman  and her restless mother  sarandon  that leave their home town in wisconsin for beverly hills   at first portman hates her mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends  and the two begin a very tumultuous relationship that goes up and down over the course of a couple years  usually down  might i add    although this explanation is a little vague  the plot can only be summarized vaguely  but when you see this movie you will see that the plot really is not so vague or weak  for it is actually very deep  what i am saying is that the plot is outlined weakly  but then they focus in on it to make it strong   and it is very strong  but also the plot sequencing is great  and there are a few brilliant scenes that i hope will someday be seen as  classic    i loved this movie  i laughed  i cried  and although  admittedly  there are a few loopholes  it s still a stellar movie and it really comes together in the end,1,
a bus drops off a nameless man outside a run down standard oil gas station in the middle of nowhere  we never learn where the bus came from  or why he is on it  or who he even is  why is he the only passenger  is he a prisoner  is he the  bothersome man  referred to in the title of the movie  has he died and gone to heaven  or hell  like our man  we don t get a chance to stop and wonder  he is met by a gatekeeper of sorts and shuttled off to a nondescript city  from day one  all the choices are made for him  an apartment has been rented  a job has been found  an office assigned  in fact  his life is not entirely unlike life in the virtual reality of corporate cubicles and suburban condos  women are heartless  dinner parties are a drag  office jobs suck  but some pieces don t fit the puzzle  silently efficient  gray clad goons roam the streets  are they some sort of paramedics  or the secret police  and why are there no children  is the story even set in the real world  whenever we think we might be getting some answers  new mysteries unfold   the bothersome man  leaves you half relieved that it s over  half wanting more  i hope they make it into a computer game soon,1,
not entirely sure how i stumbled upon this movie  but i m so glad i did  initially  we were put off by the fact that it was subtitled  but even my dyslexic brother who hates to read  especially at the weekend  enjoyed this film  i found the script fantastic and the way it was delivered in such a dead pan manner only added to the puddles of pee on my sofa  not entirely sure whether it s quite so funny to the native danish as the comedy seems to be enhanced by the tonelessness of the subtitles and the ambiguity of the translation  i haven t watched many danish films  or any for that matter   but judging by this film i m guessing they re not constrained by the same political correctness as elsewhere  gawd bless  em  making the character of eigel a breath of fresh air  because let s face it special needs are funny  there are so many great one liners in this film it puts american sitcoms to shame,1,
i had the chance to watch blind spot in barcelona and i enjoyed it tremendously  i thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that i d seen for a long time  one of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations  the three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling  they are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye  the dop s work is just great  that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time  the mood of the desert floods everywhere and even the scenes filmed in the streets of los angeles or san francisaco seem to be a natural extension of it  the story rides you smoothly through all these beautiful settings to lead you to a bitter sweet ending  being the perfect climax for this perfect journey  the construction of the film itself is a master craft  the skilled use of innovative resources  like stills stitching danny s memories into the film  will compare to those hand made pieces of work so rare and so enjoyable  blind spot achieves to capture the essence of the desert taking you to an universal common ground where anyone of us can feel being both discoverer and native,1,
i feel that this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who actually care about each other  they may have faults  but bitterness and put downs have no place with these girls  try to find that on tv or in the usual movies  it is a breath of fresh air to see girls being feminine  wearing beautiful  feminine dresses and shoes  contrast that with the apparel in stores today  i e  raggedy and faded jeans and jackets  etc  the story line has an evil thread running through but that is what makes it more realistic and interesting  i know that it is animated  but it still gives you a feeling that families can stick together and come out okay  i would recommend this movie for boys and girls alike,1,
this is a lame comedy   here s why  a man and wife sitcom  okay   the husband is a douche bag  the wife is the einstein   how original is that    jerry stiller is just the same guy on seinfeld   the gags are lame  no witty one liners   i have had enough  stop this now   the last word  stupid  the destruction of the average white guy continues on abc  the worst part  kevin james is actually a funny comedian  he just isn t here  leah remini is great eye candy  but is unlikeable  wasted talent is the word  bad sitcom,0,
reports of this film s brilliance appear to have been greatly exaggerated  and unless the other reviewers were watching a different movie  i fail to see how anyone can find this film anything other than dull  unscary  uncreepy  overlong  and at times  unbearably irritating  i m not some schlocky horror fanatic  i love j horrors and euro horrors over american horrors any day  but i feel the need to warn any potential viewers about this film before they invest two hours of their life in it   it could have been so great  a reporter is investigating a series of bizarre deaths and occurrences  which seem ostensibly unlinked  but a series of unnerving tropes appears to connect them   dead pigeons  thudding noises  the presence of strangely tied knots    our reporter goes from person to person  interviewing them  filming them and then passing on  three important characters are among this jumble of people  a young  shy psychic girl  an immensely irritating  insane psychic man  and a crazy old woman and her boy  whose importance is not revealed until later on   the problem is that the film is not even remotely interesting  which makes its two hour running time unforgivable  it s also not even remotely scary or creepy  supposedly scary scenes  like shots of ghoulish faces are done incredibly poorly  shown twice  or worse  we are told when they are about to happen  other techniques  such as telling us that a family just interviewed  died five days later  simply don t make me care  let alone mildly creeped   the film does pick up a bit towards the end  as our reporter  cameraman  psychic and cursed woman go to a village in order to  remove  the curse which is linking all these deaths  however  by that time  i was in a state of catatonic boredom  and couldn t care less  so all the fairly creepy camera work and shocks were wasted on me  the  final tape  is quite good  but once again  i d given up caring and just wanted this film to end   boring and dull  not scary and not creepy  i would advise you keep away from noroi  it has promising moments  but this is a film that was poorly made and not worth your time,0,
i can t really criticize this film  it is literally the first film i ever remember seeing and lead to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals  fortunately  seeing it again years later  it held up fairly well  rod cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths  no one believes him  including his best friend  played by cesar romero  whose brother was among those killed  and rod cameron was the only survivor  the film was shot in india and has some good scenery  the acting is on a high level  i don t believe rod cameron  cesar romero and marie winsor ever turned in a bad performance  the mammoths  when they finally arrive are fairly effective  the ending also has an unusual twist  particularly for a      s science fiction film  definitely worth seeing,1,
i really wanted to like this movie  because i love troma and loved the trailer and loved  ghouls   another of ferrin s films  it did have some almost good moments  like the oldies love song playing over the car crash scene  and a scene near the end where the protagonist gets some closure  but on the whole  it was just boring and mildly unpleasant   the  unimaginable  shocks that ferrin came up with were really predictable and worn out  poop  murdering prostitutes  incest  could have still been good  but poorly done  unsure whether it was trying to offend  amuse  or both  ultimately did neither   in conclusion  we watch troma movies because we want films with heart  this film did not consistently feel like it had heart  there were some good scenes  but ultimately it was dull and unpleasant,0,
when i was a younger oh about   i watched barney for the first time  and liked it  but  back then i didn t exactly have a brain  either  and now i look back and see what a horrible show  barney  really is  first of all  everything on that show is creepy  barney  the main character  is a horrendous   foot tall talking  purple dinosaur that teaches    year olds about  imagination       shudders   b j  i know what your thinking about his name  is a smaller yet creepier yellow dinosaur that is put in to be  supposudly  cool  but in fact  he is the exact opposite  after watching a few episodes with b j  dumbly trudging in with his slightly turned back cap  and making a few no so funny jokes  i wanted to scream  baby bop oh oh god   vomits  oh oh oh anyway baby bop is the worst idea of a character ever  she is a green triceratops it s a dinosaur  that carries a yellow blanket  her remarks of  hee hee hee  and barney s praises cries of  super deeee doooper   make it hard to sit through each episode  as the seventh graders learn about shapes and manners   and that  my friend  is what makes this show truly horrible,0,
hit and run is a shattering story starring the always wonderful margaret colin as a society lady who  has it all  until she hits a child with her car and leaves the scene  hence the title  the tragedy is that she goes to call for help and returns  but is frightened away by angry passers by who think the hitter abandoned the scene  this was made in the days when not everyone had a cell phone or there wouldn t be a story   colin s guilt and anguish are palpable and cause her to act so strangely that a detective gets onto her right away  her lies sink her deeper and deeper into a self loathing hole  causing her to make a bad situation worse   this is a very thought provoking story  and one can t help but to feel this lady s pain  wishing throughout that she would simply come clean   as a tv movie  thanks to colin and a strong script  this is a well above average tv movie,1,
this is the third three stooges short that the team ever made  and like a lot of their early ones  this is absolutely and totally hysterical  now owning it on dvd as part of the three stooges collection vol     whenever i feel like it  i watch this    in this short film  moe  larry  and curly play these three doctors in a hospital who are trying to help out everyone  but boy  they end up making a mess out of everything   this short is another one of my all time favorite three stooges shorts  i also am a very huge fan of slapstick comedy  and the three stooges are the kings of slapstick    when i heard that it got nominated for the academy award for best short film  i really became curious about this  when i heard that it had lost  i was very disappointed about it    this short is one of the three stooges funniest by far  i extremely recommend that you see this hysterical riot,1,
this would definitely not have been my kind of movie  but my husband saw it on tv and said it was really good  so  on his recommendation  i bought a copy  since i didn t know if it would ever be on tv again  i had never heard of anybody in it except armand assante  at first i had a hard time getting into the story  because the first part of the movie is a jumble of images   and it doesn t make much sense  it is only later in the movie that it all comes together  the scene cutting  if that s what it s called  is a bit jarring   it sometimes looks as if a few frames have been cut out of each scene  and the scenes are jerky  but i guess that was done to add to the unusualness  if that s a word   the story veers here and there  and just about the time you have it all figured out  everything turns upside down and you have to readjust your thinking as to who is the bad guy and who is not  or bad woman  the acting is very good   i kept thinking how much norman reedus looks like leo decaprio  the ending was a real twist  totally unexpected  which i liked  a good show,1,
i just got this movie for christmas and have already added it to my favorites list  a cute and simple story which makes a beautiful movie  who could not love uncle felix or not have their mouth water at the sound of all that food  definite points go to sydney greenstreet for his performance of alexander yardley and also to reginald gardiner who played john sloane  the impossibly boring fiancee  truly a gem to be watched every christmas,1,
the gig is a tight  funny and poignant little movie about a group of friends that have gathered together on a regular basis to play dixieland for fun  the group unexpectedly lands a real paying job  in musician s parlance  a  gig    they travel to upstate ny for a two week gig at a summer resort minus one member  who bows out due to contracting cancer  at the last minute  they hire a professional to take his place  things get sticky as an over the hill frankie valli type attempts a comeback at the resort and tries to utilize the group as his band   the attitude the professional bass player gave the guys rang true  by signing up to play the two week gig  they were taking bread out of the mouths of someone who needed the job to feed his or her family  while pop  rock  rap  country and western  and r b stars make money off of albums  jazz musicians have to travel abroad to make a living  almost nobody gets rich  the guys living their dream also cost others a needed income   i believe that almost everyone who can play a musical instrument with some proficiency dreams about playing a paying  gig  one time or another  woody allen and kevin bacon are two popular examples of this amateur to professional crossover  i especially recommend this movie to anyone who has ever played music professionally  my mom  who was a musician  loved it,1,
peter yates film from the pen of steve tesich is a relatively low key  thriller  that doesn t really manage to get off the ground  story concerns the mysterious murder of an influential asian business man and the subsequent implication of a pathetic vietnam veteran  james woods  who  the police believe  may have taken revenge on his ex employer  as the  eyewitness   william hurt never believes his friend is capable of such an act   hurt is well below his usual strength  and one finds it hard to sympathise with him or an uninspired sigourney weaver  james woods and christopher plummer do a little better in their support roles  worth noting is the appearance of morgan freeman as detective black   in retrospect steve tesich s story is only an unlikely romance dressed up as a mystery flick  the plot is far too contrived   friday  october            video,0,
this is one of the worst movies i ve seen in a while  the acting was just soooo bad  anthonie kamerling is usually a fairly good actor  but in this film  he sounded like he was reading his text from a piece of paper  especially his voice over was extremely wooden  beau van erven dorens was completely over the top as frat boy fraser  although this probably had more to do with the crappy dialogue   ik ook van jou  is an adaptation of a book  and it seem like the makers of the film forgot that film dialogue follows different rules than literary dialogue  it all sounded way to bookish   some of the situations were very badly visualized  example  somewhere at the beginning of the film there is a scene where a canoe goes over in a rapid  this bit is just too incredible to be true  you see an obviously rather shallow bit of river  with a lot of rocks right beneath the surface  hence the rapid   we hear some suspenseful music to warn us that there s danger ahead  a canoe with to girls goes over in that rather shallow rapid  our hero then dives several meters below the surface to rescue one of the girl  girl swoons in his arms and utters the words  you saved me     vomit   it actually was so bad  that it became funny  this is sad  because it really wasn t intended  at the intermission i overheard some guy behind me say  o god  there s another part   my feelings exactly  what scares me is that the end credits of  ik ook van jou  were in english  does this mean that it will be released abroad  just when the netherlands were starting to get a good reputation after films like  antonia   antonia s line  and  karakter   character,0,
i loved this movie  i m shocked and disappointed that it never made it to the theaters  every story was better than the last  much better than the much hyped  scream  series and  i know what you did last summer and way better than the terrible  urban legend   i d recommend this film to every horror fan,1,
weee this is still jolly good fun  as with most of my friends  we had seen this movie on hbo when we were young  and then had been searching ever since for a copy of it  when they finally rereleased it a few years ago  we had a midnight madness party    and the movie held up well  sure  it s pure cheese  but it s still a lot of fun  if you didn t see mm when you were young  you might not appreciate its value today,1,
that is the promise of the trailer i saw and by which i rented hitch  exactly  a serious film viewer shall not expect much further from this title but  surprisingly enough  smith  mendes  james and valletta managed to reach a theatrical performance which could be metaphorically summarised on their rap dance floor routine by the end of the film  their characters formed an effective combo which may prompt more than a good laugh with this sunday afternoon dvd  providing your date is not an exquisite  french swedish directors of the    s movie fan   p s   the techniques to score are all true  especially the  cocktail girl  routine,1,
completely overlooking the whole movie adaptation of a video game  this is another terrible movie by mr  boll  how he continues to be hired to make movies is a constant surprise to me and obviously most of the movie going community   as a whole i will say that this attempt was fractionally better than so many of his previous attempts  some of the dialog was even half way decent in far cry though he still misuses some phrases and in some cases he doesn t even use the phrases correctly   now besides the fact that jack carver is supposed to be american and not german  til was still entertaining in this role  one exception is the laughably lame lines he uses to get in bed with the girl  and we are supposed to believe that she is ready to have sex with him so casually after such minimal dialog  emile  simply there for comic relief i am sure and still lame  jack s character looks old and tired yet is still capable of the extreme acrobatics needed to avoid one of the altered super soldiers in the lab   don t watch this one for the far cry adaptation  but you might just waste an hour and a half watching it if you have nothing better to do,0,
i remember seeing the trailer for this film and i absolutely knew i had to see this movie  it looked like something that would be right up my alley    the united states of leland  is a terrific movie  it is not one that will leave you with a nice  pleasant ending  but with a sad  empty feeling instead  and when i say it will leave you with an  empty  feeling  i do not mean that as a bad thing  i believe that you are meant to fill that empty feeling with your own thoughts about the characters and human s general motives and how they act as parts of society   ryan gosling is perfectly cast as leland  he is intelligent  yet stoic  i like the way that he narrates the film with his journal  the supporting cast is terrific as well  kevin spacey is very good  as always  and don cheadle is amazing as leland s teacher and mentor    this was a great story and is very smart and thought provoking  i highly recommend it,1,
ok  so there s always people out there that seem to make it a point not to like movies because they re good  but instead choose to like movies based on how depressing or boring they can be  or whether they re from a foreign country  all that aside  one crazy summer is the perfect example of what a great american teen comedy should be  the jokes are a good mix of slapstick  a la bobcat goldthwait   surreal  bobcat under the inspired direction of steve holland   and dry  john cusack  one of the most morosely dry and funny actors in american cinema   and there is no character in this movie who does not deliver at least one funny line  ok  except demi moore    yes  it s immature  yes  it s screw ball  yes  bobcat dresses up like godzilla and trashes a scale model of a seafood restaurant  it s also funny as hell  watch it,1,
i can t think of anything  i repeat  anything positive about this  movie   the whole   hour    minute movie could be shrunken into a short   minute movie  in most scenes  there is absolutely nothing going on and it seems just the camera was left on recording on purpose only to increase the time of the movie  all you see is someone in the background walking around or watching tv with no specific subject or even talk what so ever  i just feel i ve wasted     minutes of my  my family s and my friends  weekend for nothing  if a movie is poorly made or the scenario isn t great that s whole another story  at least it leaves you something to discuss about but about distant  i just have to call it a  movie  because it was motion pictures recorded by a camera   if you haven t seen it  imagine a     min long movie based on two three lines of story  what will you end up with     of content and     of fillers  that s exactly how  distant  was at least for us  actors did a great job acting roles that had nothing special in them  they barely talked or showed any special emotions  i picked up this movie in the comedy section of a store relying on what i read on the back of its cover  i m still wondering what was funny in it other than our face after watching the movie,0,
i ve been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early    s  i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft core fluff  a genre i m not particularly interested in  the dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical  making sense  no doubt  only to it s franco italian producers and the plot completely extraneous  what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood  the scenery  the beautiful philippines   soft focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today  it is truly one of my great  guilty pleasures   i was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy  a worthwhile moodpiece,1,
call it manipulative drivel if you will  but i fell for it  sure  there could have been more character development  yeah  there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant  movie of the week  score  but ed harris was impeccable  cuba gooding adorable and touching  and let s face it people  in real life  how many of us really get to know the motivation of others  not many  we did get a little glimpse into the coach s motivation  a very provocative dialog in my opinion  not to be soon forgotten  so in my opinion  this was a lovely tribute to one human being who broke out of his  comfort zone  to reach out to another human being  and in the mean time  touched the lives hundreds more  a lesson we all need to me reminded of  why is it that the right thing to do is so often the hardest thing to do  i recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart  you won t be disappointed  and bring your kleenex,1,
i m a big fan of the first critters movie  the second episode is good but it s not as good as the first critters  the third episode is a little bit boring but lovely  and what is this   what a crap  it s stupid and really really boring  it s the worst of the series  i can t watch it again because i felt asleep at the first watch  and ug s evil side   eeewww   that s one of the most horribble moments of the movie  in the first    minutes we can t see the little furry monsters that s the reason why the audience fell asleep at the beginning of the movie   it could have been much better,0,
fred was such a great show it was simple but somehow very addicting i can still remember the days when i d watch this on kids wb saturdays  but then kids wb did the unforgivable kids wb became like that older relative that tries to act  hip  and  funky fresh   shudder they became like that relative who tries to act all cool  but the attempt is a cheesy disaster they pulled coconut fred s fruit salad inland and all the other good shows to put on some of the most pointless shows i ve ever seen in my life johnny test  the only thing that keeps me watching kwb anymore is the occasional bits of the old shows and the anime on  kids it was such a huge mistake to pull this show off of the schedule this brings me back to my first point    bring it back,1,
terry cunningham directs this sci fi network original  all is not well in washington state and oregon  volcanic eruptions and earthquakes threaten to drop most of the pacific rim in the ocean  trying to keep the world from plunging in ecological havoc  a crack team of scientists led by dr  jake rollins luke perry take a massive earth drilling vehicle called  the mole  to chew its way to the earth s fiery core to avert impending doom  technical dialog doesn t really help or speed this movie along  the acting is lame  but then perry has always been laid back  you can only blame him for taking part  others in the cast  michael dorn  adam frost and michael teigen,0,
there is a lot to like in this film  despite its humble trappings of a preachy pc tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim  the movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes   i  for one  was sure it was the teacher  in fact  that would have been more probable plot wise because the idea of the best friend s boy friend kind of came out of nowhere  i guess the point of that is that  rape is omnipresent  you never know who it is going to be    ms  beller is luminous as always  yet see kb discussion board for my qualification of this statement   like all preachy films the plot lasts    minutes past the climax so you might want to quit watching at that point  unless you are really curious to find out what happens to phillip  blythe danner  as the mom  is in the role she was born to play  the fretting  over protective mom  some good   s scenes for   s fans   the dark bar that the father goes to in order to drink away his pain is all dark stained beams  barrels  oak and cork   a must for beller fans and highly recommended for fans of   s high school melodrama or   s kitsch in general,1,
an absolutely baffling western featuring flash forward sequences set in an insane asylum  south of hell mountain was one of the first films produced by the schlockmeisters at cannon film  co directed by william sachs  who would later deliver such fan favourites as the incredible melting man and galaxina  the film tells the very dull tale of a trio of gold robbers who stumble upon a cabin occupied by two women who are hiding some secrets that aren t worth discovering  the cast  most of whom never made another film  try gamely  but are hamstrung by the screenplay  which generally makes no sense  the asylum scenes are edited in to little effect and are punctuated by ridiculous sound effects and tape loops  ultimately  it s a lot of talk and little else,0,
as a big jim carey fan i took my seat in the cinema with optimism  after all  fun with dick and jane appeared to have all the raw materials to make this another carey success  after the opening five minutes of good humour it seemed that this film would provide but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in  the idea that a charming  charismatic  top v i p employee could suddenly find himself turning up to work in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get your head round the fact that this guy has also become a master criminal is virtually impossible  the actors seem confused with the situation as well  of course  the stereotypical  rich  uncaring head of the operation doesn t struggle one bit to pull off his one dimensional character but for carey and others around him the job is a whole lot harder  one minute dick is seen as a cocky office pro  obsessed with possessions  the next minute he s a bumbling mess who can barely string two words together  and ultimately he becomes a petty thief who is able  quite happily  to put a gun to another man s head  jane is equally confused with her role and her character never really gets going    the idea behind the story is such a good one and it is a shame that this film has not managed to make it work  the odd moment of laugh out loud comedy can be found but it is usually more physical humour than anything witty or clever  carey tries his best in parts to save a sinking ship but his comic talent can never flourish in a character that has so many gaping holes to his personality  carey shines when he is presented with a strong  daring character  man on the moon  the truman show  ace ventura  which this film never presented him with  despite its best efforts,0,
and believe me that s a pretty stunning accomplishment  take  jolly roger  massacre at cutter s cove   change the killer from a pirate to a prospector  change his obsession from buried treasure to old gold  and his color from puke green to deep blue  you now have  miner s massacre   the problem is  at least  jolly roger  was entertaining enough    albeit in a so bad it s good way    to keep you watching it for the whole two hours  there s no strip joint murder scene or any bizarre killings  i can t tell you how many times i lost interest in  miner s massacre  and started doing dishes or cleaning around the condo  and  the ending is absolutely silly  the   er dude just randomly re appears out of nowhere to kill the local sheriff  while the lead actor and actress are sitting in the sheriff s cruiser  screaming  a truly horrible movie,0,
there are many distinct problems with the movie  killshot   for one  there are way too many coincidences  the husband is a hunter and just happens to be hunting on the day that the main killer shows up  with someone the killer knows  okay i will take that one  the kid calls the real estate agency that the wife works for and asks for money to be ready when he comes to get it  okay  i will take that one as well  before he goes to get the cash he decided to rob our killer  who doesn t kill him but decided to go with him on the job  it s starting to get real weak  then they show up  on the same day that the husband has an interview with his wives boss  no one is there but the wife and the husband who has decided to make his way into the empty office  they make their way into the office and the professional killer just assumes that they are talking to the right guy  that is just in the first    minuets   there are a lot more holes in this movie then i care to talk about  why the killer didn t just kill everyone at the real estate agency i don t know  why he didn t shoot the woman on her porch  i don t know  why he kept letting that dumb kid make all those stupid moves and mess a whole lot of crap up  i don t know  why the girlfriend was even in the movie  i don t know  why he decided not to pocket the gun and just leave it out on the counter  i don t know  why they even went into the witness protection program  i don t know  what i do know is that the casting director did a great job  the director of photography did very good work  the location scout picked great locations  and the production designer was worth every penny  so my advice for anyone that is going to pick a script that is going to be so well worked by the crew  make sure that every attempt to kill someone by the hit man is not foiled by a peak through an open window,0,
i found this movie to be mostly a p o s it was low budget but that isn t the problem the problem is the movie is just lame it doesn t really make a lot of sense yes it does explain why things happened but that s not what i mean there was just no reason for it all the movie also moved very slow the last ice age was quicker than this also  i think they went overboard a bit in the kills i don t mean they were too gross but the killer just seemed to spend too much time smashing his victim over the head or stabbing his victim  maybe i m being petty but i just didn t like the movie the whole thing seemed like a lower rate version of  when a stranger calls  and maybe that was the whole point but so what for me  when a stranger kills  is a,0,
i enjoyed this film  the way these mutants looked  along with the tone of the film  is very good  plus  david cronenberg as philip k  decker was great  it makes me wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life  except for the killings of course    i was impressed with the creatures for this film  although this movie probably had a somewhat low budget  the mutants creatures monsters looked great  especially from       this is definitely a unique film and not crap  it makes me want to go find a read the novella it s based off of  this is an interesting film because it shows how humans can be monsters and the  monsters  are the one with humanity,1,
this       movie     is      horrible       you won t believe this hunk of junk is even a movie     critters  was better then this    and critters  was pretty frigging bad too    a bunch of stupid teens crash in a desert  find an old run down bungalow  and end up fending off horrifically badly stop motion animated spiders  pardon my french  but the acting was bad as hell    the person who wrote this probably didn t even know what a spider is  because he had the spiders living in a colony serving an alien queen ripoff queen spider  spiders do not live in colonies          this  movie  is a piece of crud    at the end  the marines suddenly pop out of no where and kill all the spider without even being called     if you see a copy of this movie at a video store  douse it in gasoline and throw a match at it,0,
when this movie was made in       i was a teenager in the football stands playing as part of the audience  this was done at mooseheart  illinois  the big letters spelling out  mooseheart  at the top of the stands were covered up with a banner in the movie  the director would tell us to cheer loudly at certain points  as if a touchdown was being made  st  charles juvenile correction center is a real place less than    miles from mooseheart  although i think it may have closed down recently  during one scene  they show a black woman and a white man in the audience watching the game  right below them  you can see my sister noel s head  she was    at the time   in the vhs version  i can only see the top of her head  but when i saw it on tv in      i could see her whole head and my sister jacqui as well   i thought the movie itself was ok for a made for tv movie  since there s already a description of the movie here  i need not repeat it  it s worth seeing at least once,0,
there s a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee  the bimbo in the office shows off the bargain she got for      closeup of tag   later  mary astor finds the tag in the boss s bedroom  proof that bimbo slept with him   still later  mary astor is about to have an affair with ricardo cortez  looks at the price tag of her silk negligee       and is reminded of how disgusted she was about the bimbo  as well as the fact that she s spent    less than the  most obvious  woman she s ever met  it sounds an obvious morality turn  but it was well done  the film would be stronger if robert ames  character had been played by a more powerful actor  he s too low key for a self made salesman and he spends most of the film with his face turned away from the camera   and if ricardo cortez had been given more to do than smile ironically  both male leads are bland and forgettable  and are hindered by the pancake male makeup so popular in this film s era  however  the mary astor character is interesting  appealing and believable  behind closed doors is well worth seeing,1,
due to its predictable  second rate title   the one it was distributed under in italy  at least  i didn t expect much from this movie  thought it d be another cheap flick about a haunted house   la casa maledetta  means  the cursed house    well  i had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene  the constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres  reminded me a bit of the exorcist and some of its decent italian rip offs  but this was going to be something completely different    this is more like hitchcock meets italian thriller  very well written and directed  good actors  interesting plot    ok  i ve tried not to spoil the viewing of    hyden park  for you  which i d highly recommend to everyone    p s  am i wrong  or when joanna crawls or tries hard to stand  she s paralyzed from the waist down  her feet and legs move a little too much       and i m not talking of the  bad dream  sequence,1,
haaaarrrryyy    the amplified  dispassionate female voice could have been leona helmseley in heat but  no  it belongs to allison hayes as nancy archer  the    foot woman of the title  in the most infamous role of her film career  allison s performance literally rips off the roof  in fact  make that a couple of roofs   jaw droppingly tacky   aot  fw  is the tale of nancy  a neurotic  boozy heiress and her loveless lothario husband  harry  william hudson  who also co starred opposite the amazing colossal man   nancy has a close encounter of the third kind  in the desert  with a bald giant from outer space who wears a mini skirt and gladiator sandals  and who has a thing for nancy s jewelry  what he does to her once he s carried her off is probably best left a mystery  but soon nancy starts to grow   treading into the center of town on tranquilizers  tightly wrapped in nothing but the bed sheets  the buxom giantess heads toward the low rent saloon where harry is having a few laughs with a floozy named honey  yvette vickers   the confrontation turns ugly   the poverty row f x make the alien giant and nancy appear to be transparent due to incompetently transposed images  you ll understand why director nathan juran changed his name to nathan hertz on the credits  juran was no stranger to directing giant creatures  human and non  having also directed  the deadly mantis    the  th voyage of sinbad    jack  the giant killer  plus several episodes of tv s  world of giants  and  land of the giants     a lot of laughs for all the wrong reasons,0,
though it pains me to some degree that i m bothering to christen the comments board for this new series   mainly because i d hate to give the false impression that there s actually any semblance of public interest in it   i feel compelled to throw in my chips on this one   to put it simply  never before have i felt so persuaded to root for a tv show s swift and merciless cancellation based solely on the merit of its promo ads  and  in case you re wondering  i m a dude   listen  comedy network  though your existing original programming is already  shall we politely say  of a  questionable  quality  i m looking at you   girls will be girls   you have truly outdone yourselves on this one  whoever green lit this thing could not be further out of touch with what s cool right now   best of luck,0,
although not the most technically advanced film i have seen  this was a fun and enjoyable couple of hours  the main characters are sweet and you really get to like them  and feel something when susie q  has to go  but feel good again when she returns as maggie   lots of stock dialogue  and a contrived plot line  but most of all  lots of fun,1,
okay  so the movie went straight to video  if i had paid to see this  i would ve been disappointed  but  at   am in the morning  alone at night  it s a pretty good fright   hey  that rhymes,0,
now really can u call that a movie  i knew some of the movies that japanese people do are good for nothing but this bad  i mean com om i fell a sleep three times at this movie  no horror at all  some tiny percent           comedy  action let s just admit that it has some but the scenes are poorly filmed  the actors are pathetic  none of the actors did a good job in it s own role  the were not convincing  the script is also awful  i mean this movie may be great  really  but for the    s in not      sure   i recommend not to see it  unless you want to get so bored as i did  i can t quite figure hot this movie got it s rating  it s over  over  over rated     this is a personal opinion of course  i don want to offend anyone but who could like this crap  so i hope this helps someone not to loose some time  enjoying  this movie  nevertheless it s your choice,0,
nicely filmed  a little uneven   nobody  is a good evening s entertainment  the plot is simple enough  three yuppies get into a scrap with a group of strangers in a bar  and it turns out to be much more than they bargained for  the acting is decent  and there are a few unexpected twists  watch for the completely unbelievable  like the    shot revolver  and    shot semi automatic handgun,1,
this is another case of hollywood arrogance presuming to eclipse french style  the original  mon pere ce heros  was one of the most charming films of      so naturally the accountants in hollywood thought they could hire depardieu and phone the rest in  they did  however  take the precaution of hiring francis veber to write an english version albeit one utilising virtually every word of the original  depardieu brings his gallic charm and katherine heigl shows all the promise that is now paying off  the thing is that when the french make a sort of lolita lite they get away with it because the  dirty french postcard  thinking works in their favour  here the hollywood idea of lightweight subtlety is to have depardieu  totally unaware that his daughter has let it be known he is actually her lover   prevailed upon to play and song  something french   launch into a spirited version of thank heaven for little girls  see the original,1,
this is about one of the worst movies i d ever seen  it s not the worst though   manos the hands of fate holds that honor   this movie has a lot of problems  to begin  this whole movie is a cheap rip off of the conan movies  there s the babe in a skimpy dress wearing a hubcap  the quiet asian warrior  the cookie cutter bad guy  the almost mindless soliders  and so on  there s lots of continuity errors in this film  some of the dumbest errors i ve ever seen are in this film   fortunately when i watched this film i seen the mst k version  joel and the  bots make the film watchable  otherwise i probably would ve turned it off five minutes into the film,0,
when i saw this on tv i was nervous   whats if they messed it up  millions of families like mine that live with a brain damaged man  in my case my dad  would be let down  i watched it with my mum and we both ended up crying  it was so accurate and captured how the family feels as well as the person having suffered the brain injury  the actors were all wonderful and i had no complaints  my mums told me she hasn t been able to stop thinking about it  i hope this program made many people aware of what it s like living with brain damage and what it s like for the families  more programs like this should be made  i was surprised at how good it was and it s really shook me up emotionally,1,
the opening was a steal from  eight legged freaks   a film that is everything this one isn t  stilted and pedestrian are the words that apply   along with others that can t be repeated    drifter type returns to his home   town  meets up with old friends etc     the usual annoying kid  single mother local loudmouth and so on  bad special effects  alien ship  atmospheric disturbances   hey  didn t the director see  close encounters     good acting  good story  good camera angles  good cutting  not here  do not rent  unless you are sharing the cost and have a lot of beer handy  do not watch on tv  go and drink a lot of beer instead   you ll enjoy it more,0,
this opens with the company credits informing us it s by world international network   i knew i d seen this company credit before but couldn t remember where   but knew it was at the start of a really bad movie i d seen so i seriously thought about changing channels   only thing was i d seen every film on the other channels which is one of the problems of being an imdb reviewer   what the hell i thought it won t really matter if wanted is good or bad because i ll still be able to review it for this site   as i expected wanted wasn t all that good   it s a plot i d seen so many times   too many times   before involving a fugitive on the run   a bit like the incredible hulk tv series without the shirt ripping   jimmy crosses the mob in an entirely contrived way and goes on the run and in an entirely contrived manner finds himself working at a catholic reform school   have you noticed an oft used description in the last sentence     entirely contrived   is the answer   let me repeat for the hard of thinking that this is an entirely contrived film where everything relies on coincidence   another problem i had was the reform school run by the church   it s far too compassionate and kind   i m led to believe these type of establishments make alcatraz look like a country club   i m saying this is a fact but when the head priest looks like the spitting image of donald rumsfeld you do feel there s a large amount of sugar coating going on    to be honest despite the ridiculous plot twists etc wanted isn t really a bad thriller though it s a terribly good one either   i never really had the urge to switch it off no matter how contrived it became which is an under hand compliment to the movie,0,
all i can say is i really miss this show   my wife   i just got married around the time this show started up   why did cbs take it off the air    i think it was the best show for the whole family to enjoy   it made me laugh   it also made me cry  but when cbs took it off the air my wife   i thought cbs made a big mistake  you know what would be so great   have a reunion show   that would be so cool     anybody know if it is on dvd yet   on the last season of promised land  did cbs show the whole last season   i think cbs took it off the air at mid season  my wife   i will never forget it  the opening with that theme song was fantastic    this show only comes once in a life time  may we never forget promised land,1,
i agree with the comments regarding the downward spin  the last view shows have been a little better  but surely the writers need some more direction  i think the characters are still interesting  although sometimes they spin into the  white trash  things a little too much  subtlety and nuance goes a long way on shows like  office   i would think the target audience is somewhat similar being they are both on the same night and lineup  one would think that karma and the whole eastern religion thing is a big enough topic to bring some different and interesting shows  but they only scratch the surface of the subject  in my opinion it shows the contempt that many people have in hollywood about the level of intelligence of the masses  we can handle more heady content  it has been proved before in many other shows,0,
screening as part of a series of funny shorts at the sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival  this film was definitely a highlight  the script is great and the direction and acting was terrific  as another posting said  the actors  comedic timing really made this film  lots of fun,1,
people with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going  but the thing is far from being simply a horror classic  the fact that the extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day cgi is only a small part of why this movie is  finally  rightfully regarded as a masterpiece  technically brilliant in its camera work and editing  superbly scripted and acted  one of the best openings  one of the best endings  tension and paranoia sustained throughout  with countless viewings   an excellent soundtrack  and open to multiple readings and analogy  there simply aren t enough superlatives to do this film justice  absolutely essential viewing,1,
the book of life was rather like a short snack  whetting the appetite for hartley s next full length movie   this movie doesn t need to be seen on the big screen  watch it with a few friends who are hal hartley or wayne wang fans  or better still  try to convert some newbies,1,
i ve never really been sure whether i liked this documentary or not  it was shown on channel   before a cut down version of revelations  and is on the revelations video tape before the uncut show  the documentary is basically friends of bill saying how great he was for an hour with video clips of the show mixed in  a bit like a trailer for the film you re about to watch  it also features david letterman grovelling like a worm for dumping bill off the his show before he died  the reason  bill made a joke about how pro life people should picket funerals  and letterman had pro life advertising  anyway look out for the video as revelations is bill at his ranting best,1,
the student nurses is an excellent film that deals with four women bonded by friendship and career  for the first time  one is able to see a realistic portrayal of relationships inside the work place  outside the work place  the risks of those relationships  and the consequences  this film also offers a rare chance to see veteran stage and television actress katherine  scottie  macgregor as the nurses  instructor   miss boswell   ms  macgregor is best known for her performance as  mrs  oleson  on the television series  little house on the prairie   the direction  music  and print color are very good as well as the opening theme song performed by clancy b  grass  iii  this film offers a rare opportunity for those who enjoy themes centered around the late     s and early     s  which offers a  softer side to life  while appreciating the beauty of the female sex,1,
there are no flaws in this production  perfectly entertaining  fun  and worthy of respect   this is what theatre is all about  definitely not for the very young  but slightly older kids will get a great kick out of seeing it and can be introduced to theatre this way   astounding and amazing,1,
well  i ve watched this movie for over    years now and it s still almost as interesting as when i first saw it  it is definitely one of the most unique films ever made   i still think martin sheen got  dissed  big time in the billing  too  he dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than marlon brando  who only appears in the last    minutes of this   hours     minutes film  theatrical version   how unfair is that   sheen is fantastic in here  especially his narration  which runs throughout  it s one of the best narrations  if not the best  i have ever heard in a movie  his voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible  nightmare like adventure  i never fail to appreciate his work in this movie   the other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes  ones i have never forgotten  such as        sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movie s first scene  robert duvall and the totally out of place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with wagner s dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters  the playboy bunny entertaining the troops  frederic forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle  the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride  the appearance of hippie journalist dennis hopper greeting the crew in cambodia and then brando s bizarre character  it goes on and on with strange scenes   that s not to say i enjoyed everything  no  there are a few very unpleasant scenes  such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half  can t watch that anymore   an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by sheen s young stoned out crew  and the crew is a little too goofy at times  then  there is the huge amount of profanity  led by way too many f words   so  there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this one thing for sure  it is a film you will remember,1,
what exactly do people expect when they watch an al adamson film  are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories  you d think so by some of the reviews  al adamson s films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy  not much more  so if you go into them knowing that already it helps  and they aren t necessarily to be taken at face value  especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value  first off  this starts by ripping off the end theme music from outer limits  so you know things are looking promising  this is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body  the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital  of course nurse sherri tends to his needs and all  and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her  and nurse sherri begins to change  no longer the nice nurse  she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects  there s a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of sherri s co workers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo  this is not bad if you re a cult film fan  but it may be bad if you re a  spiderman  fan because you won t like it  at times this actually lurches towards  respectability   for adamson  anyway  but then it  unredeems  itself with some ridiculous event  if you enjoy adamson s films and similar trash you may well like this  for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure  keep digging    out of,1,
please do not waste six hours of your life watching this as i did  the fact that i did is not a very good reflection on me  the only redeeming acting job in this clunker was by wes studi  how a  prequel  with similar roots can not even be in the same universe as lonesome dove is beyond me   it was a disjointed  rambling  incoherent story  plot lines were not developed  action scenes were almost laughable and the big ending  disappointment  was a fitting ending to this mini series  val kilmer who i have thought as a reputable actor played one of the strangest roles that i have ever seen him in  his final scene in the show had to have been a filler by the director  i have been reading these reviews for years and this show prompted me to sign up,0,
it s a good watch if u have time   deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight  and get into serious trouble  they find themselves fighting some shadowy people  and can t deal with  very  very disturbing portrayal of japan  the arbitrariness of modern life    some intense scenes  but a bit of a potboiler  the spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on english sub titles  obviously  i don t know japanese   the only other japanese movies i ve seen were kurosawa  who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre  so  can t really compare  otherwise  it compares better with most hollywood  blockbusters  for story plot and buildup   taptieg,1,
the      version of  enchanted april  manages to be simultaneously tedious  and perfunctory  it is difficult to show the transformative magic of italy shooting in a studio with only stereotypical italian behavior to belabor  the transformation of the four strangers fleeing london is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later  rather than develop  the screenplay flips a switch and the  characters are different   the husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up  even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their shells and or hostilities   jessie ralph has the most fun  moving instead of entirely chewing up the  scenery  and katharine alexander has some poignant charm out of her  husband s shadow  and away from his hideous droning   ann harding is  unremarkable here  with the production code being enforced   she had an  appropriate line in an earlier  pre code  movie   when ladies meet    you re  not worth a minute of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you   but in  enchanted april  can only look hurt  rush out  and proclaim fealty to her errant husband,0,
the worst movie i ve ever seen  and i ve seen allot  acting is horrible  plot is awful  idea is terrible  and no research was done what s so ever  ok  i admit   air bud  was a pretty good movie  but not  soccer dog   this  dog  is smaller than my cat  how can he possibly play soccer  even for    years old kids it won t be a problem to kick the ball hard enough to brake the stupid dog in half  it s horrible  don t watch this movie,0,
no doubt about it  this is the animated short that put uncle walt on the map of success  when walt s older brother roy suggested that the next mickey mouse short should include sound  walt jumped at the chance  the result steamboat willie was a runaway hit for       it was  after all  the first animated short subject with a synchronized sound track  mostly music   sound effects as dialog was minimal   not to sound like a wet blanket  but the short is far from perfect  animation prior to      was creaky   rather herky jerky  but once equipment made improvements and better artistic techniques came about the rest was smooth sailing  and the sound was primitive  disney wanted to use the then well known rca sound system or the western electric noiseless sound system but was refused by both firms prompting disney to use the photophone system that p a  powers was experimenting with at the time   the plot  there s an actual plot line here  concerns mickey  as the aforementioned willie is the pilot of a steamboat  that is terrorized by black pete  captain pete to you  and decides to have a jam session on ship  using the various animals on board as musical instruments  aspca  take notice   if you don t think too much about the technical shortcomings  steamboat willie can be eight minutes of fun  and a piece of history,1,
it  s easier to watch this film if one views it as a scenario created by star fleet lieutenant reginald barclay during his holodeck addiction   barclay is a recurring star trek character played by dwight schultz    dwight schultz is miscast as oppenheimer  oppenheimer s character is poorly written  so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge  instead  we see a shallow  two dimensional figure from a soap opera  paul newman is also miscast as general leslie groves  but this movie s problems go beyond having the wrong actors in the wrong roles   the factual errors and great liberties taken  with the chronology of events  in order to advance screenwriter bruce robinson s political agenda make this movie embarrassing to watch  that s probably why this movie has found a home on the so called history channel     fat man and little boy  combine bad science  bad history  bad screenwriting and mediocre acting to produce a movie that should not be viewed by impressionable high school or college students who know nothing about the manhattan project,0,
at times when i watch this movie i start to think that the people who made this movie were on drugs what s wrong with this film i ll tell you bad plot bad jokes bad acting and flat out characters everything just bad   the movie is about pest vargas a two bit scam hustler who is given the chance at         to survive for    hours by a german hunter who kills people for a living so now pest must think of ways to out think this hunter before he gets killed   i know what your thinking  what the hell is this   a another wannabe ace ventura trying to get money really this plot is just dull and confusing at times it changes the story plot and you get lost during the film   as for the funny scenes this film i had a straight face oh yeah i did smile a couple times but nothing laugh out loud besides the jokes are corny and seen before it s like watching ace ventura meets dumb and dumber but bad   as for character development it s dry and flat you don t learn much about the main character pest all you know is he s a annoying scam hustler but that s it he doesn t change his image or be a little smart just corny as for the german hunter all you is that he s crazy and wants to go back to germany really you start to wonder why is this guy living on an island if has money to go to germany the hunter s son himmel fares better but not much he s really a coward and is snake obsessed for reasons by the end he stands up to his father and sides with pest   as for the acting no only were there any memorable perforamces but just over the top for example john legizomo is so over the top with performance and dosen t fit in his role he s out of place as for jeffery jones who plays the hunter same thing but gives a stereotypical performance as well as for the rest either just no used enough or just over the top   overall bad comedy that you ll find for       at k mart,0,
this is one of the worst anime series i have ever seen  when i watched the manga review in a magazine  i thought it was maybe interesting  but when i got the chapters i realized it was a complete stupidity   ok  the first   or   chapters are ok  and the series have an standard  but as the plot advances  it becomes totally incoherent  the series tries to show some mystical based upon the christian mythologies  but it s a total stupidity  it features some demons and stigmata scenes    totally nonsense  it seems the series tries to seem deeply thought  complex or mythologically reviewed  but a watcher with a bit of brain and cultural references  will realize soon all those elements used don t have a real sense  they are put there only to impress the ignorant watchers    the final chapters are full of totally nonsense elements  battles with cat eared demons  references to a supposed fight between demons  and demons who controls time  with no apparent reason   the final is totally nonsense  an ignorant watcher will see on it a floating final that gives them a place to meditate  but the truth is this  the final and the complete series is a total incoherent and incongruent nonsense,0,
i thought that this movie might be a good spoof  or at least a good independent comedy like friday  instead it was more like something someone in high school would make with their parents  camcorder  it wasn t just the low budget that makes this film bad  many great films have been made on a low budget   it is simply a bad movie and it wasn t even bad enough to be good camp  case in point  for the first ten minutes of the movie nothing happens except the   main characters sit in their room smoking dope  put on their makeup  and then answer a phone call  you keep waiting for something to get story moving  but it never comes  the sound was so bad i had to turn the tv up all the way just to almost make out what they were saying  which wasn t interesting anyways   if i pay to rent a movie i will usually suffer through it even when it s bad  but it was all i could do to sit through    minutes  it looks like the person before me felt the same way because they didn t rewind the tape and left off about the same place i did  the only reason i gave this a score of   is because the rating system doesn t have negative numbers,0,
why does the poster   artwork say  clubbed is one of the best uk indie films i have seen in a very long time  screen international  when it was a quote of the french distributor reported by screen international  an influential film trade publication   see www screendaily com screendailyarticle aspx intstoryid       which reads    pretty pictures has acquired all french speaking rights to neil thompson s clubbed     james velaise  president of pretty pictures  said   clubbed is one of the best uk indie films i have seen in a very long time     isn t this rather misleading  the distributor is bound to say it s good  are the other quotes real,0,
when taken as a whole for its ideas and dissection of the current   party system and political process  i think this is a great film  granted the movie was not the comedy i expected  but once i got over that this film really made me think  so much of what we see and hear in regards to any election is such a joke  there is in particular a debate scene in this movie that i felt was a masterful critique of our political debates and how policies are  discussed  at them  i encourage anyone who thinks our process is fine to go see this film  if you want something to laugh at however  robin williams and christopher walken are not their usual selves  in this movie they show us that the truth hurts  not that the truth is funny,1,
this movie was disappointing  after    years  when it was brought back to mind from reviewing some info about mariel hemingway  all the regrets i felt about the movie came rolling back  while i remember peter o toole  i was entirely oblivious to the fact that the female  lead   okay    she was little more than an object for discussion in the storyline  was ms  hemingway  i saw this movie back in the days when i wrote movie reviews  and warned people off it  as the stories just didn t work  and fifteen years of my subconscious trying to sort things out still hasn t made sense of the flow of the ideas   part of this may have to do with the fact that it looked like  after the original movie  whatever it was about  was filmed  an editor came in and tried to piece together something out of it  i don t know if this had been a project of a previous studio boss  and so was sabotaged to discredit him or her by the successor  or this was a disaster from the original screenplay that attempts to salvage were unsuccessful  the theatrical version just didn t work,0,
i walked into a book store in brentwood  tennessee  i am not going to say the name because i am a dedicated customer  i have been satisfied with every item i purchased there before this one  on display in the front of the store was the bell witch haunting   might i mention this is the only store i have seen it for sale in   i had heard about the story somewhere and remembered it was supposed to have really happened for real  i was very excited and couldn t wait to watch it  i had great expectations for it  i couldn t believe what i seen when i viewed it  it didn t look like a real movie  it looked like a home video  i was under the impression it was suppose to be a horror movie  i mean the movie was suppose to be about a witch haunting you know  this is no horror movie  you will not jump out of your seat watching this movie  i gave the movie all the chances in the world to get better as it went along  i swear i did  it never did get any better  there were several scenes of this little kid getting poop and pee thrown on him  i didn t find that entertaining at all  i watched the whole movie with disbelief that the store would actually sell this to me  i guess that is how bad this economy has got  i have this to say to the cast and crew  do not show this film as material to get other film jobs  don t do it  i mean that sincerely  i commend you for trying  for people who have bought this  i say this  don t sell your copy to someone  they could get very upset  have a nice day everyone,0,
a fairly interesting look at some characters from india s burgeoning middle class  although india is rapidly modernizing  her culture is not keeping up  this film involves the patriarchal society  where women are not yet truly free citizens  a land of arranged marriages  men who dally with mistresses with total impunity  and women who are expected to tolerate all this  will eventually come up short  i was impressed with nandita das  who was quite attractive  and played her character with total earnestness  but i was even more impressed with shabana azmi  who i understand is a long time fixture of bollywood  her quiet beauty and low key psychic suffering was excellent  the lesbian subtext of this film was never particularly erotic  and never titillating   darn   worth a look for those interested in vastly different cultures,1,
anybody interested what black film making was like in the    s watch this film  some the dialog in this film is so funny ie the summary of my submission  also watch out for the boom mic to show up in some of the scenes as well as some of the best karate action ever  don t take this movie seriously or you will be disappointed  go into it with an open mind and step into the world of one the the baddest mutha in the world dolemite    editing wise its put together like it was sliced with a razor but once again this film is so much more than what you see in the movie it has influenced the black community in ways you cant understand,1,
this      film narrates the story of the mutiny on board battleship potemkin at the port of odessa  the movie celebrated the   th anniversary of the uprising of       which was seen as a direct precursor to the october revolution of       following his montage theory  eisenstein plays with scenes  their duration and the way they combine to emphasize his message  besides he uses different camera shot angles and revolutionary illumination techniques  the  odessa steps  sequence in potemkin is one of the most famous in the history of cinema  the baby carriage coming loose down the steps after its mother has been shot was later recreated in brian d  palma s the untouchables  it is clear that the film is one of the best ever made considering its time and how innovative it was though you need a little bit of patience and to be a real movie enthusiast to go through its    minutes,1,
i loved this film  fantastically original and different  a solid  intense  hard core and suspenseful movie that has just the right touch of  dark   humor  if you re tired of the typical  overdone  ridiculous hollywood b s  movies  how many big explosions and awful and unrealistic shoot em up gun fights that insult your intelligence can we take  then this film is for you  fantastic characters that are wonderfully original and believable  and solid performances by all actors  not a weak character or performance in the film  skip woods  film is a breath of fresh air and i applaud his originality and efforts  his film has the feel of a cross between a quentin tarantino and a cohen brothers film  not a bad mix at all in my opinion   this movie grabs you by the throat and doesn t let go  there s nothing boring or bubble gum about this film  the only disappointment is that nobody seems to know about it  everyone i ve recommended it to has thanked me and shared my opinion on it  this film is a welcomed change alternative from the canned hollywood mainstream garbage being produced today  even with their big name actors  big explosions  special effects and huge budgets  it s a terrifically wild  intense  violent  graphic  humorous and raw  i mean that in a good way  no phony hollywood polish here  ride  thank you to everyone involved in making this film happen  you did an incredible job,1,
well  i may be bias as i grew up watching a vhs copy of this film that is now ready to snap and have just spent the last couple of hours tracking down a dvd copy as a birthday pressie for my dad  the film is so harmless and inoffensive it suits all ages     much better than anything disney ever made in my opinion  and i used to work in the disney store      the characters are enjoyable and the award for best scene is a tie between the disrupted wedding  especially the musical talents of swat  the fly  and smack the mosquito   and the amazing night club scene  the musical numbers still have me humming    years after i first watched it  there is no other film that i can better recommend whilst baby sitting  and in fact every child i know  thanks to my hoppity loving parents  have seen this film  many times  it will always get top marks for its fabulous love story  a brilliant baddy and over all originality,1,
square really landed this one  they didn t try to please everyone and instead focused exclusively on final fantasy   fans  and boy  are those going to be happy fans when they see this movie  the story might not be all that interesting or credible but it ties in neatly with the story of the game and has several honest to god funny moments   a total surprise there and a welcome one too  there are lots of cameos and funny references to the game too  and most important of all  the fighting scenes rock so hard they could cut through diamond  they are truly the total awesomeness and would have made the movie worth it even if everything else sucked  i mean  they are some of the best ever created period   see this movie  bye   ps  i know my review sounds like the ravings of a teenage girl  it was  like  totally what i intended,1,
note  i ve tried not to give away any important plot twists  or the ending  but if you re concerned about that  please think about viewing the film before reading further  thanks   this was obviously a fairly high budget production  released by paramount  the story follows the  supposedly true exploits of hiway man jack shepard in      s london  he was a locksmith who got blackmailed into a life of crime by the nefarious  thief taker  to save his brother s life  after being double crossed by the thief taker  we turns into a sort of robin hood type figure and gains the support of the common folk  he proceeds to make escapes from several prisons  including the infamous newgate  as well as having time to  entertain  numerous noble ladies   i really enjoyed the film  even though the plot was a bit predictable  the film was shot in glencree and wicklow ireland and the sets were very well done and seemed realistic  i think clavell captured the bustling atmosphere of london in the      s quite well and i enjoyed his creative use of camera angles  and  unlike many films depicting this period  clavell pulls no punches in showing us the deplorable conditions in which the poor lived  in one scene several folks fight over a meat pie that has rolled through the filth in the street    overall  i really enjoyed this film  i will admit that it lacks the wonderful scenery and underlying political commentary that clavell s next film the last valley has  a parable to the vietnam war   but it still merits a viewing or two  it is regrettable that it has not ever  to my knowledge  been released on video or dvd,1,
i have seen a number of horror movies to know that this one was one of kind  full moon pictures has a knack of giving this fan an entertaining night  for all the cheesiness of most vampire films  this is the one that has not only a good premise but has two good sequels  a must see,1,
excellent story telling and cinematography  poignant  biting social commentary   superb effects  well filmed and acted   however  the parallel action between the present and the travel adventures  though very well done  at times drags on a little too much  about   hrs   and over interrupts the flow of the story   i first read the book as a child  and enjoyed the parts about the giants and the tiny people    but the book lost me when it got to the floating island and the land of the  yahoos   well  although the adventure plot may sound like a children s story  it s in fact a very adult story  full of symbolism about the moral decay in england at the time of jonathan swift  the author of the novel that the film is based upon,1,
priscilla  queen of the desert is always being trotted out as a masterpiece of australian cinema  i found it quite disappointing  the lead actors are great   terence stamp is aging beautifully  guy pearce should do more comedy instead of the dour roles he chooses and i ve been a fan of hugo weaving since i saw him play oberon eons ago  the cinematography is great  but if you ve ever been to the australian outback  you d know that the air is so clear and the light so brilliant that they could have shot it on the movie equivalent of a box brownie and it still would have looked spectacular   so what s my problem  well  three things  first  there is not a sympathetic female character in the whole film  a woman who has to earn her living shooting ping pong balls out of her privates in a roadside pub deserves our sympathy  tick s wife doesn t get much better treatment   second  the scene when they sing  i will survive  to a group of aboriginals is offensive  to try to draw any sort of parallel between the struggles of drag queens and trannies and the almost total destruction of aboriginal culture  which is what i assume the scene is supposed to do  shows a level of historical understanding worthy of paris hilton   last of all  and the greatest defect of the film is that it just isn t funny enough  did stephan elliott actually talk to any drag queens when writing the film  anyone who knows a drag queen  or three or four  knows that most of them have rapier like wits and they re not afraid to use them  now  i can understand that a lot of drag queen banter probably would have got the film refused classification but elliott should have been able to gather enough  fit for the kiddies  material to complete his film   so  all in all  a waste of a good idea and a great cast,0,
joline  heather graham  sets out after her husband carl  luke wilson  who disappeared to clear his head about himself and their marriage  joline  who is committed to their marriage starts her journey to find carl  yet on the way discovers a lot about herself  on her trip she encounters a bountiful of interesting characters who unknowingly help her find her way   in my eyes this is a classical road movie  which moves just at the right pace  some viewers may find it too slow   throughout the movie it keeps its humorous note while joline responds to the craziness of the world around her with a warm  knowing  sometimes sad smile  all actresses and actors give wonderful performances and the musical score is immaculate,1,
what we have here is a film perfect for anyone that participates in the world of post industrialism  those who sit in their privatized home  earning money by buying and selling sensual less commodities and perpetuating a system that values little other than the preservation of self   the beautiful filming  i always appreciate fix   s and soft boxes  makes it an even stranger place to travel through  both enjoyable to look at but frightening to comprehend  perhaps that s overly dramatic  but its true    andreas  journey through his hell is overwhelmingly tragic  his quest is honorable  laudable  and precious  the conclusion is necessary and we are left not sure if he s better off  which is the perfect conclusion   breve  highly recommended to all people who view their world with a critical eye and especially to those who don t  perhaps it will encourage a reflection or two,1,
is it really possible that so many people in this film believe that the girl is a witch  just because she has dark hair and wears dark make up she is supposed to be a witch  and i got the impression that the film tries to present her as someone who is  different   someone nobody understands    she is just a teenager and some dumb girl in her high school says she is a witch and everyone believes her  besides  brandi is either portrayed very badly or the character itself is made to be so    fake  she didn t convince me that she is not a witch  not that i would believe it in the first place  everyone accuses her of being a witch and she acts like she is not entirely sure whether she is a witch or not  and the way they dressed her for the court   i see old ladies every day who wouldn t wear that even if it was the last outfit in the world  brandi s brother also wasn t very convincing    but  you see  the important thing is  that  she put that bad  bad girl back on to the ground at the end of the film    she has won the battle  proved to everyone she is different    this is probably one of the worst films i ve watched in may life  way too shallow  i only watched it because there was nothing else on the tv at the moment  so i was condemned to this trash  please  do not waste your time watching this film  when i saw the   star rating  i nearly fainted    it doesn t deserve it  compared to some other films which are also rated with   stars,0,
this may actually the finest film of       no i m not kidding  this documentary directed by chris smith captures the very spirit of artistic compulsion  smith does the smart thing any documentary filmaker should do  he keeps invisible and refuses to judge his subject    as the viewer watches mark and his efforts  no matter how funkily aggressive they may prove  to finish his films  he refuses to compromise and suffers repeatedly as a result  but lest we forget  remember speilberg  scorsese and others started just as humbly   and what a great subject he chooses  mark  his family and friends are all fascinating characters  far more than any character created in last year s fictitious cinematic products this film oscillates on the dime between comedy  tragedy  touching sympathy and leads us ultimately to inspiring any viewer with an urge to create  despite talent issues  to get off their butts and make something   the film is about maverick artists and their passions  it is also about families  no matter how co dependent and disfunctional they may be and how unique and beautiful that organism truly is  mark proves in the film to be utterly devoted not only to his dreams  but also to his family as well  and they to him    why this film was not nominated for documentary of the year is beyond me and criminal  that is assuming it was eligible last year   this film is to be sought out and treasured,1,
probably one of his lesser known films  it suffers from the same lack of exposure as salvador in that its actually one of his best   written by and starring eric bogosian  talk radio tells the story of an opinionated radio phone in host who upsets the wrong kind of listener  the film is important  and has much to say on the issues of free speech and just how free it should be  and you can easily tell that it started life as a stage play  know what you re getting into before you sit down to watch it and you ll be fine   there isn t much to the acting really as bogosian pretty much steals the film  he wrote and is given licence to rant  i couldn t take my eyes off him and that was part of the fascination many of the listeners had  the people who hated him wouldn t turn off in case they missed something   not for everyone  but a very good drama and overall a very good film,1,
i can t believe this terrible film was made by the same people who made lepa sela lepo gore  watch that and skip this  the plot is muddled and the characters are mostly two dimensional stereotypes  i suspect the editor went on vacation halfway through the film because quick  choppy cuts start to appear that only confuse matters rather than elucidate them  the ending doesn t make sense either   this is predominantly a propaganda film made so serbs can feel sorry for themselves and vilify america for the nato bombings of       they do this by perpetuating lies about serbs being our allies during wwii  claiming the whole world is unjustly against them  and completely ignoring everything said and done by slobodan milosevic  like waging war on three neighboring countries  they seem intent on making a political film but only show a few seconds of milosevic on a tv screen with no sound  a nationalist agenda obviously superseded any consideration of art which was not the case with lepa sela   regrettably  i recommended this film to a teacher when it played last week at the seattle international film festival  he also cited the bad editing and confusing plot  and i had to apologize for the bad advice  you ve been warned,0,
hello it is i derrick cannon and i welcome you to the first ever cannonite review show  my movie for this week was debatable  what route what movie  what excellent four star epic would i choose  guess what i decided to pull a one eighty and go the other route  i ve decided to review a movie so atrocious that it totally killed what could have been a very unique concept  the movie i will review today is jack frost two revenge of the mutant killer snowman  the stars in this movie include christopher allport as sam tiller  eileen seeley as anne tiller  marsha clark as marla david allen brooks as agent manners  sean patrick murphy as captain fun  ray cooney as the colonel and scott macdonald as the killer snowman himself jack frost   it s hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny jack frost loved the carrot scene  but it s even harder to believe that this is the exact same cast  the movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and captain fun was introduced  what was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie the only possible reason i could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was total killer snowman fodder  sam tiler seemed more paranoid then he did in the original  his babbling about anti freeze was one of the most pathetic display i had seen in a movie  his wife however was one of the few bright spots  she played her role as the main woman to a hilt  she was a voice of reason in film of pure idiocy  the scene where she figures out how to kill the snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie  ray macdonald once again did a great job as jack frost despite what he was given  if it wasn t for such weak characters he could have been immortalized like chucky freddy and jason  laugh if you must but when it comes down to it jack frost had spunk  he had humor  and most importantly he had an undoubtable vicious streak   this movie could have been so much more  it could have been a continuation of a great franchise  instead any plans to make a jack frost three have been canceled   this movie gets a two out of ten for me  and it s lucky that it even gets a one,0,
story about a widowed father  claude rains  bringing up his four daughters  emma  gale page  is loved by big hunky ernest  dick foran   thea  lola lane  is romanced by an old but wealthy man  kay  rosemary lane  wants to become a singer  ann  priscilla lane  is a romantic  drop dead handsome felix deitz  jeffrey lynn   a business associate of their father  comes to stay with them  all the sisters fall in love with him  then tough cynical mickey  john garfield  enters the picture     very entertaining movie was a big hit and nominated for five academy awards  it s beautifully directed by michael curitz  has a pretty good  if predictable  script and a very attractive cast  especially lynn   also this was john garfield s first film and made him a star  this was so popular there were three or four sequels  which i never saw   this is an engrossing  entertaining  big budget soap opera  well worth seeing,1,
i went to see this movie today  with hopes that it would involve an at least half intelligent story  i was extremely disappointed  as it did not  the plot  and the decisions by the main character  were so far fetched  i was hoping for a  dog day afternoon  type movie  but instead got something totally unacceptable  i actually found myself totally hoping for the  hero  to be knocked off  and i nearly walked out of the theater on several occasions when this should have happened but didn t  heist movies are notmeant to be feel good flicks  and this one tried to be just that  every couple of minutes during the second half of the movie  i found myself saying   no way   without giving the whole story away  it revolved around an armored car guard who was financially down and out  and whose house was going into foreclosure  he was invited in on a heist  and accepted  only to back down once the action began  weak,0,
this movie was an embarrassment  ulma thurman looked like she had some kind of disease and john travolta looked like he was walking in his sleep  i was expecting this to be a so so sequel to get shorty not a half baked remake of the exact same movie  except that some of the character s have different names and clothes   i would not recommend this to movie to my worst enemy  i feel like i was ripped off and hollywood has once again tricked me into seeing another horrible sequel   i also suffered through alien vs  predator    the best thing that i can say about this movie is that it has my vote for the worst movie of,0,
a new wrestling show paves way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable  the giant zeus  network president brell does everything in his power to draw wwf champion rip into the squared circle to face off against zeus for the championship of the  battle of the tough guys   but zeus is unlike any competitor rip has ever faced   normally i would give hogan some leeway as a wrestler crossing over into a movie role  however this film didn t ask the hulkster to make very much of a stretch  it simply asked hogan to play himself  which he failed at miserably   tiny  lister made a good effort as the mighty zeus  but even his work left the film lacking something  namely acting   watch this movie  if you so desire  with a grain of salt and a sense of humor  otherwise you will probably have to turn it off a little over ten minutes in,0,
i was amazed at the quality of this film  particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director   all        lbs of him  truly  a boy directing a movie about a boy  i look forward to seeing more luke eberl films   i did think this one was a bit too long  there was too much time spent showing connor being unsuccessful  and unwilling  to make a move on owen  caleb didn t try hard enough  owen  being so young  could have easily become closer to caleb and later decided it wasn t his preference  and owen would still have learned the  valuable lesson  about corruption and politics  instead  he didn t give himself a fair chance to learn about his sexuality  and what about poor caleb  owen could have been a good influence   though the film intends to show owen as a hero who overcomes perverted corruption  i felt sad for owen  he was offered the opportunity to have some boy boy fun with caleb  who was extraordinarily beautiful  owen didn t have to go along with the political perversion as offered  but he could have tried to have some fun with caleb  and still walked away when he wanted  it was clear that owen was in charge   no one forced him to do anything he didn t want to do  but he could have had more fun  and with a very hot boyfriend  at that   i hope luke makes more movies where appealing young characters have more fun,1,
hell to pay is a bit bloody for my taste  even though it is no worse than many films  nevertheless  i did enjoy the parade of seasoned stars and the western scenery   all  but  the story line was very weak and i couldn t really see the point of it all  however  the music that accompanies the movie more than makes up for the lackluster film   where did the guys  nate   noah cryns  who wrote this music come from  they are awesome   from the moment the music begins  it is by far  better than anything i ve heard in years  i think it may be the best i ve ever heard  even though i wasn t thrilled with the action taking place on the film  the music evoked the exact emotion that was needed for each scene  i was transported in time to the old west during the opening credits and really felt like i was re living those old days through the music   this movie is definitely worth a purchase and a viewing for the beautiful music and a trip down memory lane to see the old western stars once again,1,
in   out was a funny comedy with good performances by joan cusack  tom selleck  matt dillon  and kevin kline  the thought of kevin kline being gay was very funny  if i was him  i would hate to say i m gay at his own wedding with his family  friends  and his going to be wife there  very seldom would that ever happen  i also loved when he was dancing around when the voice on the radio was talking to him  i d say that in   out was a silly comedy with a lot of laughs and giggles  this is a recommended comedy and kevin kline had a great performance as a gay guy  trust me you ll like this movie,1,
another popular screening for a british picture at coalville s century theatre  a well crafted  solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing  twists in the tale    as the lies piled up  a masterclass of acting by a flawless cast  well marshaled by first time director julian fellowes  outstanding performance  as usual  by tom wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors linda bassett and john neville  our audience was engrossed by this film  which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you  jump   a good tight production at around only    minutes  probably produced on a very limited budget  but a success  which should see fellowes directing again for the big screen  some publicity for the film seemed to suggest it was set in the   s  as per nigel balchin s novel but obviously this is not the case  recommended viewing,1,
how do stories this bad get made  that s not a question  it is a statement   here are my problems with the film      much of the story development was predictable and boring  my emotions ran pretty much in a flat line throughout  there wasn t really much to draw the viewer into the film      the characters were decidedly uncharismatic  one was a loon  another was confusing  and the third was pretty damned boring  there was absolutely zero reason to be drawn to these people  even though i knew it wouldn t happen  i kept hoping that they would run into someone else  someone more interesting      the physical environment was uncomfortable for me  a trailer    in the desert    the desert is a place that most people would prefer not to visit  how is it that these three people end up in the desert        and in the same desert  did the writer really expect me to believe that the last three people on earth would manage to find each other within the span of a few weeks out in that desert      was it really necessary for ms  ryan to be in two scenes that required a swimsuit  hey  she looks great  but it was pretty gratuitous   okay  so if i thought it was so bad  why did i give it a    i am trying to be as objective as possible  even though i found alan annoying  i have to say that david arnott did a very credible job of portraying a neurotic nerd  the character reminded me of a few of albert brooks more annoying roles   jeri ryan tried to do something with sarah  but it just wasn t written very well  okay  so she was supposed to be a confused  dysfunctional woman  but why  what did it add to the story  her mood swings left me feeling like i was being jerked  hard   one way and then another and then another   i don t often walk out on films  but this one had me contemplating it several times  stiff  predictable  boring  proceed at your own risk   my   cents,0,
this movie is actually so poor in its desperate attempts at being  feel good  and casual it really made me embarrassed watching it  i can t imagine how the inner circle of norwegian celebs and press must have felt trying to pretend to like it at the star packed premiere  its great media reviews is a sickening example of how ridiculously small and inbred the norwegian media scene is  had a foreign film of this quality reached the silver screen it would have gotten the rain of rotten tomatoes it truly deserves   the combination of literally amateur actors  home made style visual effects  awkward dialogue  painfully idle attempts at working class humour and the overly cozy and meaningless plot  really makes this a movie of rock bottom quality  stay away,0,
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  i enjoyed it   its a sci fi film  if you want a thriller watch another channel   this is what the scifi lovers want  excellently produced by one of sci fi s best producers scot vandiver   ok the special effects weren t excellent  but what a great cast  some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects  stop complaining and change the channel if you don t like these type of films   films like mission impossible and braveheart are great but these aren t sci fi films   sci fi produces excellent films like sabretooth   alien hunters etc    well done    keep them churning out,1,
i had never paid much attention to this flick until i learned that paddy chayefsky   author of the brilliant  network    was the scriptwriter  his work there had instructed me as to his genius  so when  hospital  appeared on tmc  i was anxious to see it  i was not disappointed  looking at both this film and  network  it would seem that his big theme is the absurdity  inanity  and sheer viciousness of large human enterprises  e g   hospitals  networks  against the sanctity of individual experience and the human spirit  and all of it delivered with a knife edge sense of utterly black humor   hospital  is as black of a comedy as  network  is  and the excellent cast  led by the incomparable scott  does his work full justice  this is a keeper  definitely not to miss,1,
dolemite is one of the best movies featuring a pimp as a hero  who takes down the man  meanwhile hooking up with all the finest women that the ghetto has to provide  mind you that these women know karate  and are fine foxy ladies   spoiler  the end fight scene is pretty crazy  with dolemite ripping the heart out of willy green  make sure your copy is unrated   plus there are a cast full of innovative brilliant characters like the hamburger pimp  reverend  mayor  queen bee  and others  the apparel is great  and the sets are full of    s style  there are a few mess ups in the production  such as boom mikes accidentally appearing  among other things  but that adds to the charm and laughs   i would recommend drinking a   pack before and during this movie  and keeping squares and the man a far distance away,1,
gilles mamouni is playing with the audience with the story of max  vincent cassel  in search of his biggest lost love  monica bellucci  just before to get engaged to another woman  mamouni uses many flashbacks sequences without warning so the best way to know where we are in the story is to watch for the actor s haircut  oherwise it can get very confusing    still a strong film debut for mamouni  beautifully photographed by thierry arbogast  the  th element  the messenger   and monica bellucci is a darling to watch     i felt a little disappointed near the end so i gave it   out of,1,
this trash version of  romeo and juliet  passes in manhattan in the present days  romeo  will keenan  is an a  hole and violent member of family que  and juliet  jane jensen  is a sexy  with beautiful legs and breasts  and bisexual girl of capulet family  the scatological situations this romantic pair will face are very funny  although being a cult movie  inclusive exhibited in rio de janeiro festival   it is not recommended for all the audiences  if the viewer is fan of peter jackson s former movies   braindead    bad taste     toxic avenger    body melt  and other trash movie  he will certainly love this flick  otherwise  he will hate it  since i belong to the first group  my vote is eight,1,
i think this movie more than any other shows what a great actress drew barrymore is because she plays a ugly duckling in high school which is something i never imagined her being  a great flick with lots of laughs   i don t usually go for those feel good movies but i really enjoyed this one,1,
rutger hauer helps along a film that basically can be summed up in the young person finding themselves category  and rather obviously so  so it needs a lot of help   the beginning holds a lot more promise  of a film that could turn into michael clayton or stranger than fiction  it s too bad because i really got hooked into the beginning  then  like the opening soundtrack  it went from great and intriguing to basically nowhere   it s fun enough with plenty of curiosities and interesting characters acted well  i m sure that will be enough for many people  the problem is it all feels contrived and empty which  ironically  is supposed to be the main discovery for the character s self realization  not the film itself  it s not a self aware film   but that the character is supposed to recognize his own life is contrived and empty,0,
a very weird  psychedelic  esoteric   and did i say weird     experience   but on at least on one level   it did exactly what it was supposed to do  it bridged the gap between the silly  manufactured  hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the monkees tv program and the adult  musically growing and evolving  and yet still a little silly monkees of the    s and beyond   the most important line in the film is mike nesmith s   if they think we are plastic now  wait till they see how we do it   that the monkees were tired of all of the negative comments about their image and their work is a matter of record  they said it over and over in interviews  they needed to re make themselves  and what better way that to de bunk and hilariously lampoon the very machine that created them  and at the same time  they commented on our whole society  news  movies  art  everything  and said   hey  why pick on us   isn t all of this stuff manufactured on one point or another   these are the orwellian  proles   the monkees represented the persecuted  everyman  even at their silliest in the tv series pulling down  big brother s  pants and kicking him in his very deserving butt   loved the ideas  loved the music  loved the effects  loved the movie  but then  as peter tork says in the movie   but then  why should i speak  since i know nothing,1,
lifeforce is certainly one of tobe hooper s best films  it has some great special effects and a lot of nudity  so it seems like a typical horror fan s dream  the film is quit creative though and i think that s because of the script from dan o bannon and don jakoby  nice cinematography and a good creepy atmosphere make it a solid film,1,
this is the worst film i ve seen in a long long time  never mind the fact that so many useful things keep appearing on this island  how convenient       the acting is beyond poor from the outset  its like one of those really badly scripted soft porn films on channel    a complete waste of time  and i cant remember the lead actors name but i cant believe he still gets work    i ve never seen him act  i ve seen him in lots of films    but i ve never seen him act  here are a few of the blaringly obvious errors  apparently petrol lighters still work even when they ve been soaked in sea water    also according to this film you can walk into the sea naked but come out wearing bikini bottoms  i m guessing the camera man and editor were students there are plenty more errors but i m ranting now  besides its no so much the errors as the cast the script and the whole film avoid at all costs,0,
being a huge fan of conte d ete   http   www imdb com title tt           i was expecting to be wowed by another french beach romance with a lot of honesty  realism  and humor  same director  same actress  what could go wrong  unfortunately  pauline a la plange is a huge disappointment  it s very slow and talkative which would be fine if the dialog conveyed insights into the characters  was meaningful  or original  but it comes across as a typical soap opera alternating between irrelevant pillow talk and jealous accusations  the only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster is a small amount of character development or at least  character change  with regards to pauline  the source material is standard fare  sexual awakening during a beach vacation  but it could have been a decent film nevertheless if any of the characters were sufficiently interesting  unfortunately that s not the case  event though there are other shortcomings with rohmer s season cycle  most of his later films are definitely leagues above this one,0,
perhaps not miyazaki s best work  but i couldn t help but love it to death  a five year old boy finds what he thinks is a goldfish stuck in a bottle  he saves its life and keeps it in a bucket as a pet  but it really is a magical being  the daughter of a human wizard and a sea goddess  ponyo  as the boy names her  is taken back to the sea by her father  who tries to discourage her from returning to land and becoming human  but she gets into his magic elixirs and does what she wants to do  the story is simple and cute  where the film really comes alive  though  is in its tremendous artwork  the drawings are more child like than in any of miyazaki s other works  but there s beauty in its simplicity  as with all of his films  miyazaki creates this world of imagination that i was just so in awe of  seeing it in the theater brought back memories of what it was like when the opening notes of jo hisaishi s score for princess mononoke washed over me and gave me goosebumps just short of a decade ago  the score here is equally as wonderful   i wanted to live in this world and never leave it,1,
i liked this movie  i m not a big horror movie buff so i couldn t comment on similarities between this and other movies of this genre  but i found this movie quite captivating  the story line  albeit a little obvious  had some genuinely scary tense moments and the acting  particually of the lead female role  wasn t bad in anyway  overall i m a little surprised at the low rating this movie has gotten  i watch a lot of movies  working in a video store tends to help  and this really isn t as bad as people seem to think  i do have some criticism though  the final call from the cop was terrible  almost overacted  the dead girl in the bathroom looked liked she was having a little sleep  probably from the amount of tequila she mentioned she drank  and the children s reaction to what was happening instilled in me the hope that they were ultimately killed   hope this helps some people,1,
hulk hogan plays rip a professional wrestler who has a big heart but is pushed to the limit when his girlfriend joan severence  is kidnapped by thugs who are forcing him to take on another wrestler tiny lister jr  bottom of the barrel actioner is such a failure that even hogan looks ashamed to be in it  and with the evidence portrayed  he should be,0,
sure  the concept had already been done with alf and the charmings  thrust modern society onto one or more out of place characters  but i loved both shows and watched them religiously until they ended in       when i learned about scorch  i was actually very hopeful for something new  as new tv in the    s so far hadn t impressed me  but at least star trek  tng and the simpsons were still going    what i got was a big disappointment  the acting was awful  but considering the ridiculous dialogue and wholly unbelievable writing  i can t blame them too much for what they had to work with  there were a few humorous moments  but most of the deliberate jokes seemed forced in their delivery  the whole production work on the show seemed too low budget for what was on tv at the time  in the    s it would have fit right in   still  it was the first episode and had to introduce the characters and establish the entire premise of the series  so i gave it the benefit of the doubt  the second episode wasn t as bad  and i started to get my hopes back that once it got into its stride  the show would improve  sadly  my vcr ended up not recording the third episode aired  i never got to see it  and the series disappeared from the tv listings after that  all i have now are the first two episodes recorded off the air onto a vhs tape,0,
i have no idea what these people were thinking when they made this film  no plot  very limited action  and what is with the  rd person commentary throughout the film     instead of running around the planet to shoot on all of these locations  they should have spent some money on script writing and actors  what acting there was  was lousy  this was    minutes of my life i will never be able to get back  i should bill the director for the cost of renting this film  to the director and the writers of this film    please quit now  this film should have a tag on the front of it saying beware of boredom  the only good thing i can say about this film  is the computer generation  it s ok as generation is  this movie should never have a sequel    ever,0,
this is a great movie for all corey feldman fans  this movie has a great cast of young actors  a group of teens decide to rob a bank to get some quick cash  but all goes wrong when a security gaurd gets shot and they take hostages,1,
i remember seeing this movie    years ago and it was full of suspense and twists  it grabs you at the beginning and keeps you guessing throughout the whole movie  i have thought about this movie for the past several years and have checked in video stores to see if it s available  but was never able to find it or anyone who had even heard of it  i think this type of movie is timeless  and i know it would be enjoyed by a whole new generation of movie watchers  i hope this gets on video soon as it would be fun to see if it has the same impact on me as it did back in the early    s   it s very rare that a tv movie can make that much of an impression  but this was did and still does after so many years,1,
certain aspects of punishment park are less than perfect  specifically some of the acting  however i feel that this is probably the most important movie of the  war on terror  era  i grew up hating hippies and in some respects i still do  it wasn t until the united states was started down the path of an unnecessary and deceitful war in iraq that i began to see the world through their eyes  i can feel what they must have felt  although the film is somewhat dated  watching it brings those uncomfortable emotions about our present situation right to the surface  it s clear enough early in the film that punishment park is designed to be a concentration and death camp for all the  unpatriotic  elements of american society  this is certainly an exaggerated and extreme view of our polarized society  but it is credible  at times i find myself believing that the usa could easily slip into fascism  as i watched this film i could only think about how i hear similar sentiments from people on both sides of the political spectrum almost daily  this movie is a raw  concentrated distillation of america s present political scene  i am both impressed and saddened that something this relevant  and yes  accurate  was filmed more than    years ago  if you take a more moderate view of the movie and choose to believe that this couldn t happen here  look more closely at guantanamo bay  some of our  enemy combatants   the rumored cia secret prisons and the many incidents similar to the one in greensboro  nc in         full years after the making of this movie,1,
loved today s show    it was a variety and not solely cooking  which would have been great too   very stimulating and captivating  always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next  she is as down to earth and as personable as you get  like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable  special guests  who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too  loved the  first  theme and that the audience was invited to play along too  i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things  but she did it and by golly i ll be writing those recipes down  saving time in the kitchen means more time with family  those who haven t tuned in yet  find out what channel and the time  i assure you that you won t be disappointed,1,
three american lads are backpacking their way around europe  challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and hot babe lays as they can  but andy seeks true love  he finds this during their bungee jump attempt on the eiffel tower  when he comes across and breathtakingly saves a suicidal and heart burstingly beautiful julie delpy  his attempts to find this girl and the secret he uncovers lead he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action  romance  gore  and inspired humor  without ever taking itself to seriously  or striving to be anything other than a wildly entertaining    minute ride  i have seen this film a number of times and found it a much more rewarding experience than the  london  original  although both films are so different it is not fair to compare the two or even to consider this a sequel,1,
the gymnast        was written and directed by ned farr  dreya weber portrays jane hawkins  a former world class gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns her living as a certified massage therapist   the promotional material leads you to believe that the plot hinges around jane s accidental reunion with a former teammate  although this meeting takes place  that plot line is secondary to the main plot  which involves jane  her husband  and a professional dancer named serena  addie yungmee   the two women develop an act of the type performed by cirque de soleil  the two complement each other  jane is more experienced with heights and has tremendous upper body strength  serena is more elegant and artistic  although  obviously  also capable of incredible physical feats   the film works because we can understand how jane would turn to addie  who is caring and compassionate  while jane s husband has taken her for granted for the many years of their marriage   both women are incredibly fit and athletic  and dreya has the lean body and well defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts  they clearly are truly performing their act  and the results are so excellent that we can believe they would indeed  be a success in las vegas  or anywhere else they traveled   the sexual tension between the women is obvious  and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while suspended in the air  a woman with a neglectful husband and an attractive woman partner make for an explosive situation  which isn t resolved in a neat and tidy fashion   of the six films we saw at the rochester ny lesbian and gay film and video festival  we thought this one was the best  it will work on dvd  and is definitely worth seeking out on large or small screen  note  stay for the credits,1,
despite the fact that this was a made for tv movie  and an obvious one at that  ie   cheap looking   class warfare left me wishing i could get my money back  and considering this lame production was partially funded through canadian dollars  i might just be entitled   what made me sit through it in the first place was seeing actress lindsey mckeon  who i ve watched for the last couple years in her role as  goody goody  mara lewis on the soap opera guiding light  taking a turn at playing  the bad girl  for a change    surprisingly she does quite well  as kristen  a spoiled rich b tch who suddenly finds herself dirt poor  but with a conniving streak  and a twist of fate  that will possibly change her fortunes back around  the twist of fate is provided in the character of richard  robin dunne   a socially radical outcast who discovers that he has just gone from having nothing to winning     million on a lottery ticket  now  put richard  kristen  her jock boyfriend jason  wade carpenter   and their camcorder obsessed mutual buddy graham  dave mcgowan  together for the weekend in a remote cabin  cut off from the world by storms  and just guess what unfolds   the film suffers from congesting both the story and characters personas and motives too much  everyone is pretty one dimensional and it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out that some things  and some people  are going to go very bad  very quickly  i don t think this is that original a plot and it doesn t go out of it s way to make itself anything more  the acting is ok  mckeon is spot on as the manipulative female lead  and dunne is very good  perhaps a little too good at times  but no one else is worth writing home about  the only other real credit i can give the film is the one twist i didn t see coming towards the end  not the very end though  that one is so obvious it hurts   regardless  i sat through all of it and lived to tell the tale so i can t say it was a complete write off          a  something to watch when nothing else is on  type movie,0,
black water  co directed and written by david nerlich and andrew traucki  is very simple in its execution yet effective  the film is a low budget australian movie that will unfortunately not get the recognition it deserves because as far as creature features go  this is one of the best out there  the setup is rather basic  grace  her husband adam and her younger sister lee are touring some mangroves in the northern territory when a saltwater crocodile flips their boat and leaves them stranded in the trees  the whole movie is about their survival while the crocodile is lurking below waiting to strike unlike greg mclean s rogue  another killer croc movie released earlier in        black water is not about the audience having fun guessing who s gonna be eaten next  it is about hoping and praying that the three people will get out safely    the three unknown actors do a great job with pretty demanding roles  considering it was filmed on location with a real crocodile instead of cgi  the characters act realistically in the situation and the dialogue seems natural and not forced  suspense is built up throughout the entire film  we do not see a lot of the creature but just knowing it is near is terrifying enough  this is edge of your seat stuff and highly recommended if you enjoy original and  most importantly  scary horror films,1,
okay  it features one lovely blink and you miss it joke  when the dead are rising from their tombs  the names of the old time  horror  directors like jacques tournier and jean yarborough are featured in the tombstones  and the smashing of morally bankrupt repu con rightist villains is on target  whorish skanks preaching morals etc  but why these soldiers are anti republicans  because they have gone to the war  most of them should be republicans  right  why they don t go to killing the enemies who killed them or something  why they all want to vote against the republicans  why this story has made of a movie  questions never answered,0,
this story had the potential of a good film  the difficult choice of love versus money and the angst and regret of making the wrong one  however the movie was ruined by the horrible miscasting of robert redford as the villain who offers            to sleep with demi moore  like redford has to pay for it  redford s boyish good looks and all american charm just don t cut it as an unlikeable  threatening  boor  redford s acting skillls are insufficient to make his character menacing  i can see it now             to sleep with robert redford  ok says the lady but you will have to give me some time to raise the money  jack nicholson would have been perfect as the sleazeball,0,
cocky medical students play chicken with process that simulates death  in attempt to get a  hopefully temporary  view of the afterlife  certain plot twists and themes are a little off the mark  and the acting occasionally goes over the top  but the underlying message   about god s and others  forgiveness for our real or perceived sins   is positive and unique in cinema  and the cast is very very good  the last sequence between julia roberts and her father is so effectively done that  years after having seen it  i still get chills thinking about it  highly recommended,1,
what a strange atmosphere is being created in the streets and on the golden gate bridge of san francisco in this exciting action picture  although the characters and the story are in fact bad  it still has a certain cult flair,1,
i tried  god knows i tried to like this swiss cheese of a movie  but the story was too full of holes  some big enough to drive a horse drawn carriage through  the acting overall was even and the characters endearing enough that you regretted they died off like recently sprayed roaches  scattering off to die their own gruesome deaths  overall  however  it was not really very scary  afterall we have seen spooky quickly moving figures in the background since  the brood  why back when   and it was scary then just briefly  this film just never resolved the basic plot points and thats the writer s job  naturally you would expect the director to pick up on the fact that the story did not make sense  like who s was the secret room behind the wardrobe  why did the blood hungry ghost not die when she received the nails as prescribed by the book they read earlier  why did the computer say  game over  for frankie s character even though he lived  the list goes on and on  i don t really feel comfortable recommending this film as its makes you feel like you wasted your time and there was not enough payoff in truly scary moments,0,
this game is an action adventure with combat  there are quite long periods with no combat but other times  you have to get rid of various kinds of monsters  the monsters are not like anything you would see in real life  and they have to be gotten rid off in order to continue with your quest  the whole game is a quest  you play adam randall whose father contacts him from the beyond and asks him to come and save him  the game is from the mid      s and has to be played in dos  i used dosbox and was able to play the game quite well  the graphics are not as good as some games even of the time  mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes look quite blocky  but others look batter  but don t let that put you off the game  the game is very imaginative  its long and can make you jump when unexpected monsters appear out of nowhere  not for young kids who likely wouldn t be interested anyway  but over    or    might like this game  its a horror mystery action adventure combat combination i thought it was a great game  its had to find now  maybe ebay  but remember its a dos game and you would not be able to play it on todays faster computers  would be hard to play on fast computers unless you use dosbox  oh  and the acting is very good too,1,
i don t understand why it is so underrated on imdb   this movie is just the perfection   the better adaptation of all times of the myth of tarzan  as a french  i can say that this is the better role of christophe lambert  ridiculous in a lots of movies  but here absolutely wonderful  charismatic  incredible  the plot is great  well told  the story magnificent  the direction  the atmosphere  the music  every things are perfect  how believe these sequences with the elgar music  just simply perfect    greystoke is truly an unbelievable movie  underrated here  i don t really know why  but really appreciated,1,
this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end  not that that is bad  it was done to illustrate character trait degression of the main character  consequently  if you are not into tragedies  this is not your movie  it is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile  if you liked dostoyevsky s  crime and punishment   you will probably like this if only for the comparisons  the intriguing question that the movie prompts is   what is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publicly aproved ideas for another set   the new ideas are quite opposed to the status quo if you are a conservative you will not like this movie    besides other philosophical questions  i must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well  the grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start  also  there was use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters  if these sorts of things do not impress you  skip it  overall i give this movie a,1,
as a new resolution for this year       i decide to write a comment for each movie i saw in theater       or in dvd          i must admit that dvd have revolutionized this habit  for instance  i can hear the true voice of the cast  which is an essential trait of the personality  in my country  non french movies are dubbed and we end up with aberrations  french voice is terrible  very far away of its original tone   the same voice for different people or a same people with different voices        and well  if everybody found my comments unuseful  well  in       i will stop my reviews    ah ah     so  enjoy them now         my summary means that the story  locations  cast is not very enjoyable     only      sandra bullock is there   she is a talented actress  able to get the viewer to catch on the movie      it reminds of a feminine  the fugitive      so if you look for a moment of escaping your life  watching this movie makes it worse because sandra s life is a mess      she got nothing left to hold on to  only her poor mother  who is alzheimer ill  again the touch for depression       in fact  she has a sad life in the beginning of the movie  has a sadder life throughout it  to finally get back to it at the end     what a happy ending       maybe the writers wanted to make a point about a nerd s life      very far away from the best computer movie of all time   wargames,0,
this is more of the same thing that made this cartoon popular     but who s complaining  it s always fun to see the poor coyote try various contraptions to get the road runner  and then get pulverized by every one of those inventions   the underground cave chase was different from the normal fare and was clever  it gave us an aerial view of the chase in a maze like structure  i didn t say it was hilarious  just different from the normal above ground antics   this one  along with some other road runner shorts  are featured on the looney tunes golden collection volume   and the transfers of them are spectacular  the colors are magnificent,1,
northfork is above all a masterpiece of widescreen cinematography  for this alone the film is well worth one s time  the stark  wide open plains and badlands of eastern montana are captured in the spare  muted earth tones of autumn or early spring  the gigantic grey cement fort peck dam is the film s protagonist  the film comments both subtly and not so subtly on about a dozen issues of western landscape  the dialogue can be trying at times  yet the images and concepts are powerful enough to lift the film  the      s period works so well here and is executed so well  i think that the passing years will be kind to this film,1,
this is one of the most unoriginal  cliche ridden movies i have ever seen  even if you didn t like this film s antecedents   the bad news bears  and  the mighty ducks   they are bound to have done a better job than this one  from the moment the new teacher greets her class and they tell her   don t bother with us  we re all losers   you can see everything that s coming twenty miles away for the rest of the film    all the usual suspects are here  besides the spunky teacher  we have a group of what are supposed to be endearingly bratty kids  they re brats  yes  but no so endearing   a slow witted small town sheriff that they love to torment  an arrogant head coach of the winning rival team  etc   ad nauseum  only olivia d abo as the new teacher displays any likabilty  i never cared much for steve guttenberg before and his performance as the sheriff doesn t change things  jay o  sanders is a capable actor but his character  the rival coach  leaves him nothing to work with  let s hope that writer director holly goldberg sloan comes up with something better next time out,0,
what can i say  the little kid inside has always had great affections for the following   giant robots  giant monsters and a cackling  megalomaniacal lead villain and this movie delivers on all counts  as an adult  it s easy to point out the many flaws in this film and to say hey it s really only a bunch of episodes taken from a children s tv series strung together  despite all of this  i find the ending very moving and the content surprisingly adult in nature  tremendous fun if a little nonsensical at times,1,
good lord   i m going to say right off the bat  i only watched    minutes of this movie  as i am a hardcore eraserhead fan  the  what  you can t watch a wierd black and white movie with little to no dialogue   defense does not apply  i simply can t watch terrible weird black and white movies with little to no dialogue   this movie is what happens when you give an angsty goth child with no talent and nothing to say a camera and budget  and let him her put as much meaninglessly offensive imagery on screen as possible  it was clear from the start that this film should have been   minutes long  assuming it should exist at all   shots that should last a few seconds drag on for minutes  because the director has  i just love the sound of my own voice  syndrome  and refuses to cut to another shot until the entire piece of footage has been viewed  from the moment the girl in the mask started masturbating the corpse of  god   the opening scene of the film  joy    i knew it was only a matter of time until i turned off the tape  after at least    minutes of a different corpse being pulled around  twitching  on a rope  by a gang of cloaked mystery men  i knew it was time to give up  rarely do i give up on a movie  i sat through the entirety of blair witch    book of shadows  albeit not happily  this did not deserve the    minutes i gave it   if you re an eraserhead fan  do not let simple minded comparisons to said film con you into renting this piece of amateur trash  allow me to refer you to tetsuo  the iron man  for a watchable and enjoyable piece of incoherent black and white weirdness,0,
this movie is so god awful that it was literally a chore to watch  i wanted to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room  but kept thinking  foolishly  that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right   you lose  we win  yay   this movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that jackie mason was funny  after that  beat them ove the head with this movie until the tape cracks  and if you re even considering renting this turd  or worse yet  have   i have one thing to ask of you  didn t you even look at the cover  i mean  with crap like this you can tell with just a glance how bad it is   oy vey   this movie sucked,0,
this movie came as a huge disappointment  the anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of a pretty lame villain  but i expected shamballa to tie up all the loose ends  unfortunately  it didn t  it added more plot holes than it resolved  and confused more than it clarified  the animation and voice acting were great  but with an idiotic plot  dull setting  most of the movie doesn t even take place in dull wwii earth rather than the alchemy world   and disappointing ending  ed is useless for the rest of his days in a world with no alchemy  and he ditches winry    it was altogether pretty lackluster  do yourself a favor   disregard the last half of the anime as well as this movie  and read the manga,0,
it may not be a    out of    but for me the jokes didn t fail  i ve seen it many times when i was younger and again on dvd i believe  and i laughed each time the humor is simple and fun this film was just one of many small flicks disney was throwing out at the time  i found the parts where the people out of the invisible loop saw people invisible  there expressions were priceless great film  if the opportunity to ever see this arises i recommend seeing it for a good oh fashion laugh  my favorite character in all the dexter series would most definitely have to be dean higgins  i love his voice and hearing him get upset especially seeing his expression at the end was just pure hysterical for me,1,
why is impossible to write in french   very kitch  this journey in the center of the earth is despicable technical possibilities nevertheless current in       these big  casimir  of monsters is completely ridiculous  the film deserve however a  remake   as was  king kong   the last one   with a little more supplied scenario  the professor has resemblances with the professor calculus and is rather funny  david  the character  is enough inconsistent but cross spend  to the people from below a good message   you unite and will overcome you    altogether we would say a film made in the   s  now that i said everything  or almost  the evil of which i thought of it  we can say that if we have the brain get tired or anything has to see of the other one  then the thing matter  is even rather entertaining  hugh  such is my opinion   translating french to english with  reverso    sorry for possible mistakes,0,
what is there to say about this movie  this movie is simply gorgeous  a true feast for the eyes  in the same way that the game set the standard for  d role playing games   years ago  this movie sets the standard for future cg movies  many of you have seen the trailers and the amazing details in every frame and let me tell you this movie does not disappoint  you can actually see the fibers in cloud s sweater vest   the music is also very good  the movie contains several rearranged tracks from the video game that fans will definitely recognize and appreciate   the movie s main weakness is its story  its not exactly a bad story  but this story is exclusively aimed for people who have played the video game  first time viewers may feel lost at times  or they may not notice the significance of certain events   i recommend this movie to everyone  even if you ve never played the game because what we have here is a special movie  watch it and enjoy the the beautiful show,1,
hardware wars rips off everything in star wars  but if you are planning on doing any parody  you need to do it just a bit better than this  not that there is anything wrong  per se  with hardware wars  but if you spoof  do it well  or not at all,0,
unlike some movies which you can wonder around and do other things  this movie kept me in front of the screen for the entire two hours  i loved every minute of it   however  i have to say that the story is not very believable  especially when the foreigner was expelled by the government  and then later on  actually sent a package to the guy who helped him  xiao liu is a very good actor  he shows his emotions  and he shows his silliness  and his love toward that girl,1,
this one reeler produced by mgm in      showcases the talents of two of its young stars under contract  judy garland and deanna durbin  in a way  these short films were promotional trailers that featured new talent in front  or behind the camera  felix feist directed this one which was a way to promote the two talented stars to the public   the story is simple enough  the orchestra that entertains in a public park every sunday doesn t get the attention it deserves  enter two music aficionados  judy and edna  who love to hear the band play conducted by one of their grandfathers  two of the town s elders sensing there is no public for this type of entertainment have decided to cancel their sunday concerts in favor of a more popular orchestra that will attract a wider audience   the two girls embark in a promotional tour of their own doing what they only know  calling and running errands and being helpful to their neighbors in exchange for a promise they will attend the park concert next sunday  well  that day comes  and to their surprise  hardly anyone comes as the music starts  the two girls decide to take matters into their own and ask the conductor to play a song for them to sing  the result is clear  people all over the park flocks to hear the talented young singers  thus ensuring the orchestra s existence   of course  the only attraction of the short film is the inspired singing by the two stars who are wonderful in their rendition  ms  durbin s operatic voice blends well with ms  garland s natural one creating a lovely duet   don t miss it whenever it shows on tcm,1,
anatomie isn t very unique in horror genre  in fact it isn t even scary at all  it reminds me of its american cousins  horror slashers  it s just a copy of any other horror slasher and as a german movie it s just too american with nothing to add to it   actually anatomie is too predictable and boring  its plot is not intact and consistent  it s got stupid scenes to it which don t even fit into a horror movie genre  amusing sex scenes with pop music and topless women in underwear  why do they need to have it all in just one movie  they should have made a cheap german adult movie instead   i can t recommend this movie to anyone because it s just too boring,0,
i thought this movie was perfect for little girls  it was about a magical place where genevieve and all her sisters could do what they wanted to do the most anytime they d like  most little girls would like this story  even though there is the thought of death in it  although no one dies  the king almost does  but little girls would not understand it  so it adds up to make a perfect story  all the events add up  creating a great plot that can have a meaning if you dig deep enough  this story is perfect for little girls  and since it is a barbie movie  the kids can have more fun with it  especially if they have barbies of their own  anyone can have fun with it  though  because it is so cute and understandable  overall  i think this movie is a good movie for everyone  especially little girls  and will give anyone a smile at least once during it,1,
seriously  if i wanted to make a movie that makes zero sense  never will  and features lesbian scenes as its only high point  i could have   david lynch is the worst  as is this movie  anyone could have made a better movie in which at least some answers were given and the story wasn t so slow and long winded  the story means nothing without something at the end besides the credits  what a waste of time  i will never get those     minutes of my life back and hope that others can learn from my mistake,0,
my father the hero used to be my favorite movie when i was younger  it s about andre  a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter  katharine heigl  on a vacation  hoping to get a little closer to her  but of course  nicole isn t that easy to get along with  she just started puberty  i m guessing  she is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time  one day at the beach  nicole meets handsome ben  and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad  the whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie  i would give my father the hero,1,
i saw it in europe plex  great movie     this film is an exploration of the spirit and the flesh in modern times  protagonist jim kirk  drives an unwieldy rv across america  stopping often to fill his gas guzzling tank  he is middle aged and confused   he fuels his thick  diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter  he is the flesh  agitated and sometimes spaced out  fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort    the spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds  as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field  the spirit eventually collides with the flesh and kirk goes down  unable to comprehend what has happened to him  he s been in denial about just how bad things have become due to he waywardness of all of us  because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh  we re all in the same denial and so we  like kirk are in danger of going down and being blown away by desert sands just like him,1,
yet another foreign war movie that puts hollywood to shame  real in the same proportions that hollywood productions such as harts war and windtalkers are unreal  a moving story backed up by strong acting and great film making,1,
this is an excellent movie and should be presented every year during the holidays   christmas  beautiful with great acting  john denver at his best  i e  sincere  kind  talented  and natural  the town is georgetown  colorado and every bit as lovely as in the story,1,
how is this a documentary  much more like a walking ghost tour one might take in any given southern city  quotes were generously dropped throughout without the first effort at identifying the source  george orwell was the most identified quoter    documents were referred to without ever being produced in any form  flat out fraudulent shots depicting period film stock were spliced aside historical film reels with no separation from reality and self promotion  film reels which were entirely unrealistic and improbable for the time at hand were dropped in  as if trying to ape blair witch  hoping to drum up a spook house on what would otherwise simply be dead real estate    is this not in some way a great disrespect to actual victims of tb  a dance on their collective graves for the sake of commercialism  the line between actual footage and manufactured self service is so thin  the drippings of doubt so insignificantly played down  the scientific boundaries so blatantly ignored    how could this possibly be listed in my tivo as documentary    it s a vacation promo  and at that it fully succeeds   hell  i d visit the joint if i could locate it on google earth  not scary said a previous poster  not too serious either  says i  fascinating story  flimsy film making,0,
dr steven segal saves the world from a deadly virus outbreak  this movie strikes me as foolish earnestness that has morphed into an unintended camp classic  the best kind   memorable lines include  knowledge is like a deer  chase it  and it will run away from you  and  drink this  it will make you feel better   it is so sublimely bad    they couldn t have made it any worse if they tried   segal tries to convince you that he is    sensitive    by saving a stricken pony     a good father    by a saccharine cooking scene for his daughter     a man of science    by looking at a fake spectrum     in tune with nature    by using homeopathic remedies     politically correct and multicultural    by having indian friends     an iconoclast    by opening a rural practice after a former life in a national research lab  and    an action hero    by being really fat but yet can still fight  rotfl   it s good to see on as a late night saturday flick  with friends  preferably  but not necessarily   inebriated,0,
totally un funny  jokes  that fall flat  amateurish acting  with one or two exceptions   boring characters and dialogue that s  at best  mediocre  after watching this movie  one must wonder how on earth a producer could come across a project like this and think   i must make this film   no wonder it couldn t get a theatrical release,0,
k  one day my father picked up a movie with a  neat  cover  got home with my mom and we were like yay lets watch this new movie we never saw before     ok so it started     interesting start  cool robots and disgusting gore  eek  on a strange planet  actually it was pluto wasn t it      blablabla i could tell the whole story but i rather not point  wtf never ever pick up a movie with a lame ass name  and seriously don t ever i mean ever judge a book by its cover  err tape    it looked like an interesting movie however it was a slap to the face for sci fi movies  its disgusting  i mean it was so bad i just started laughing  i swear it tryed to be serious  i cant describe the stupidity  it killed more then a million brain cells of mine i can t even write a descent critique  its that bad  argh and i wana prepare you for something  strange   cough cough  mechanical p n    cough cough  sorry just had to say it  its so funny  think of it as a commedy or a parody of sorts for sci fi movies  its classic batman laughs but in a new packaging  what the hell was this director thinking,0,
the inspiration for the  naked gun  movies casts leslie nielsen   who had only recently started doing comedy    as the incompetent but heroic frank drebin  always having to solve an absurd case  like  airplane   and the movies based on the series  the humor relies on mel brooks style spot gags and silly comments  namely the  yes it is  remarks   along with the fact that nielsen remains very serious despite the nonsense around him  and of course  the final frame  in which something keeps moving   it s too bad that the show only had six episodes  at least it spawned the movies  you can t go wrong with leslie nielsen in these sorts of roles  i suspect that they all had fun filming it  really funny    before  airplane    leslie nielsen had starred in movies like  forbidden planet    harlow  and  the poseidon adventure   as late as      he co starred in  nuts  alongside barbra streisand and richard dreyfuss  but since the first  naked gun  movie it s been all comedy all the time,1,
not for everyone  but i really like it  nice ensemble cast  with nice contributions from better known players  like stockard channing  and strong eye candy  from sheila kelley   what really works is the bond between the three brothers  try it  you ll smile a little,1,
the thing is john carpenter s best movie  merging his talents for tension building and shocks with decent production values he turned out a perfectly crafted sci fi   horror movie   by filming in truly difficult conditions he creates a very believable isolated research base which sets the tension before anything has even happened  the ensemble cast work well together with kurt russell proving a charismatic leading man even under all that beard   by building the tension slowly with moments of gory horror  courtesy of effects meister rob bottin   currently directing freddy vs jason  carpenter creates a movie that has rarely been matched  considering this came out the same year as et it could not be more different   worth a watch   rewatch    out of      p s  the dvd is excellent  lots of extras plus the best dvd commentary going  with carpenter   russell   plus remixed in dolby digital for even scarier sound effects,1,
i am a huge fan of big  loud  trashy  completely stupid action movies such as the rock  con air etc  all of these are great fun to watch but  when you think about it  extremely silly  in the line of fire tells a story and it tells it well  with plausibility as well as excitement and suspense it also addressed several important moral questions that really make you think  the last shot of the movie is eastwood and russo sitting together on the steps of the white house watching the pigeons to gentle  peaceful music and i felt a deep feeling of satisfaction  this was because i cared about the characters and i was happy for them that their story had come to a happy conclusion  it felt like a true story  as the aging secret service agent tormented by the fact that he failed to protect jfk on that fateful day in dallas  clint eastwood is fantastic  he brilliantly conveys his paranoia and his personal need to stop his adversary  on the other side of the spectrum is john malkovich  as the creepy predator who tortures eastwood about what happened in      by openly telling him of his plan to kill the current president  this oscar nominated performance really gets under your skin  throughout the movie  malkovich talks to eastwood as if they are friends  he doesn t threaten him  he doesn t lie to him  he doesn t laugh at him  but he tortures him with his unbearable friendliness right up to the last moment  as well as this thrilling main plot  there is a charming love story involving rene russo  another agent and eastwood  despite the age difference  they have superb chemistry on screen and the director wisely does not let this dominate too much but keeps it as part of the backdrop which works nicely  to sum up  i love this film because it has a mind,1,
if it wasn t for the terrific music  i would not hesitate to give this cinematic underachievement       but the music actually makes me like certain passages  and so i give it,0,
this is  realism   if rivette was seeking to give us a ground level study of a woman in a certain place and time and how she was able to influence  and was influenced by  the world around her  he has failed miserably  most prominently because we never get a clue as to why thousands of men would have followed her into battle  there is certainly not enough exposition of the cultural historical context to define the country s need for such a savior and  god knows  there is nothing particularly charismatic about joan as she is presented here  unless bonnaire s wooden posturing and flat line readings are supposed to indicate transcendent faith and determination  the use of landscape is particularly uninspired   we never lose the feeling we are watching twentieth century actors wandering in a supposedly medieval landscape  and as for the battle scenes  which  in contrast to some commentors claims  do take up a good     of screentime   they look like look like some some history club from your local high school recreating a medieval siege  although the kids would no doubt put more passion into it  i will give rivette credit  however  for picturing a side of joan left out by other movies  that of a petulant  naive  and narcissistic adolescent  played by a woman all too clearly at least twice the age of the character she is supposed to portray  obviously unable to understand her place within the movement she is helping to create or the world existing outside her own passions  joan s outrage at her own soldiers swearing and astonishment at the enemy for their lack of respect and obedience to her are jarringly spontaneous and believable notes  you suddenly realize such moments must naturally have occurred in an otherwise uninvolving historical  representation   unfortunately they also serve to point out precisely what is not addressed on screen  what made joan special  i must say i also continued to be puzzled and frustrated by certain foreign film lovers who equate tedium and lack of dramatic involvement with  artistry  and  seriousness   does this film really increase our understanding or involvement with the subject  or with anything for that matter,0,
this landmark film can now be seen in two different versions on the grapevine video release which also includes the english translation of selma lagerlof s novel which she based on a swedish folktale  the first version is the swedish edit under the title of the phantom carriage  the second version is a reconstruction of the way it was shown in the united states under the title of the stroke of midnight as released by metro  before it was m g  m   the actual us release has long vanished but a detailed review in the new york times lets us know how the scenes were reordered for domestic release    and both are fascinating to see  each version of this film was presented at the organ loft in salt lake city with live theatre organ scores provided by artist blaine gale  a live recording was made of these performances and are included on the grapevine video dvd along with the novel and notes about the two versions  while the phantom carriage follows the order of lagerlof s novel  the stroke of midnight is in some ways easier to follow  seeing the two different edits is an education in how silent films could be changed effectively for release in different countries    some viewers look at this film as a horror film which it certainly is not  this is a morality play with shades of the supernatural used to hit home its stark message  the directing and lead performance by the great victor sjostrom were way ahead of their time  it s easy to see why m g m brought him to hollywood to direct such films as lillian gish in the scarlet letter and the wind as well as lon chaney in he who gets slapped  in america he was known as victor seastrom  he would also star in the lead role of ingmar bergman s wild strawberries  giving a masterful performance  bergman was greatly influenced by korkarlen or the phantom carriage in his earlier days    this is a powerful film that is well worth taking some time to discover and study  the grapevine video release is an excellent way to do this,1,
this movie is everything a tenacious d fans can hope for  director liam lynch partnered with the  d  is a concoction of epic proportions  of course you need to understand the humour and format of tenacious d  when i saw it there wasn t too many laughs from the audience but the reason is not a lack of humour or intelligent jokes  this movie seems to have been released on to an unsuspecting public that haven t familiarised themselves with the musical duo  this movie does stay true to it s roots  for the few of you who have seen the hbo tv series and heard the album  they have not forgotten what their audience loves  like the tv show people have noticed from the trailer the jb and kg apartment scenes and of course the open mic nights that each tenacious d episode would start and finish with  the soundtrack is phenomenal and each song blows you away      and dave grohl plays a fantastic devil   this is the perfect movie for those of you looking for a hard time and a rocking musical,1,
what a waste of a great cast  figured i d check it out because it looked like a good stoner comedy with a lot of fairly well known actors  what it turned out to be was a pointless collection of boring intertwining stories about several characters with minimal connections with each other  characters who start off looking like decent people but end up with not a single likable or interesting characteristic among them  calling it a comedy was a stretch as well   the only thing that made me chuckle was jack black s song  which was basically tenacious d  i waited for something big to happen but ended up with nothing more than    minutes of my life wasted,0,
anne christie  was garbo s   th film and the first in which her husky swedish voice was heard  she plays the lead character  anna  who has struggled with being abandoned by her father chris  a drunken barge owner played by george f marion   and with the misfortune of the life she has has to lead to keep her head above water   meeting irish matt  charles bickford  may mark the turning point for her     or does it  garbo looks and sounds great in this drama which  although looking rather clunky and moving at a slow pace  still manages to interest and engage an audience nearly    years later  marie dressler makes an impact in the role which gave her a second flush of movie success in films such as min and bill  dinner at eight  and emma  while marion and bickford are more than adequate   an interesting slice of movie history  garbo would do better talkies in the years following  but  anna christie  will always be remembered for the first time she talked on screen,1,
this is the funniest sequel i have seen in a long time it is much funnier than the other three and not a bit scary  it has some very gory pieces in the film  but not bad enough to make you sick  in this one he has a female doll companion  hence the name  if you liked the first three then you ll love this  go watch it,1,
up at the villa fooled me into thinking i d be watching something similar to gosford park   the film opens at a ballroom in     s italy which is populated by vulgar americans and uptight upper class brits   but in truth up at the villa plays out far more like a merchant  ivory production which is very bad news because it s a very slow   and i do mean very slow romantic drama with some of the romance being very unlikely   if you like slow romantic dramas you might like this movie   i didn t,0,
these cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny  and fun  puns  the first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates   alka fizz prison   no noose is good noose   inside the prison  the first sign we see is  welcome  have a seat   they then show an electric chair   corny gives way to clever  however  as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars  with pen in hand  he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it  in no time  he has criss crossed the united states  zipped up through canada and is in the northern part of that country  it s there we see the canadian royal mounted police and  of course  our hero droopy  known here as  sgt  mcpoodle   he has the assignment of catching the at large criminal from alka fizz  so  with his trusty little blue horse  he goes out in the heavy snow to track down the wanted wolf   from that point  we get the normal story  droopy always being a step ahead of the wolf  no matter what the latter does    and both characters are involved in some wild and very funny sight gags  droopy even pops out of an eagle s egg on top of a mountain  there is nowhere the wolf can go   or do  plastic surgery   to escape the intrepid  sgt  mcpoodle   nobody  by the way  in the history of cartoons perhaps has more exaggerated reactions  either  than this wolf each time he sees his nemesis  his screams  facial and body stretched out in horror each time is a big part of the sight gags    you d think this one joke cartoon would get monotonous but it doesn t  it s more good stuff from tex avery and the gang  just one of    cartoons in the  complete theatrical collection  dvd with wonderful looking restored visuals,1,
normally i wouldn t go to the trouble of commenting on a horror movie sequel  because it s usually assumed that they re bad  and if you watch them with a healthy disrespect  they can be very fun and enjoyable to taunt laugh at  however  this chapter of the ongoing halloween saga came close to gumbing up everything the original stood for  in the very first movie  dr  loomis said  very pointedly i might add   that michael myers was evil  and this tries to explain why  doing a bad job of it i might add   in my opinion  he was much scarier when he was just a blood hungry freak  the whole goth cult thing was unnecessary and a desperate attempt to throw a new curve into the halloween equation  the result was a boring  predictable movie that was not scary and not bad enough to be funny,0,
after spending five years in prison  dr  thomas reed  played by the incomparable vincent ventresca  exiles himself to purgatory flats and winds up tending bar  he soon meets the luscious  angel faced sunny  alexandra holden    you are wicked   he tells her   you have no idea   she replies as she sips her slo comfortable screw and languidly drags on her cig  reed finds himself entwined in the violent troubles of her family and the femme fatale story unfolds set against the desolation and desperation of the oil drained western town   canny direction  great performances  superb entourage work  and some lust scenes that sizzle like the sun in purgatory,1,
the lousiest of all lousy jaws rip offs was regretfully made by one of my all time favorite directors  lamberto bava  here under his john old jr  pseudonym   you know how it goes in these cheap european imitations  right  they only want their monstrous animal to be be bigger  sicker and more threatening  but this more than often results in the opposite effect  bava s creature is a humongous sea devil and it s more than just a shark  we re seemly dealing with a prehistoric monster here  with the jaws and appetite of a great white  but it also has tentacles like an octopus  it s up to a couple of dolphin loving oceanologists to discover how this monster was able to survive all these thousands of years and why exactly he only started his killing spree now  the script of  monster shark  makes few to no sense and most of the action takes place on the mainland  the shark itself is an unintentionally laughable creation and it was a wise decision of lamberto bava to only show it vaguely and in quick flashes  the acting performances are above average and the underwater photography is surprisingly clear and well handled  the twists in the plot are predictable and you ll probably have the most fun spotting detailed facts about the characters  for example  count all the cans of beer dr  hogan drinks throughout the whole movie,0,
this isn t among my favorite hitchcock films  though i must admit it s still pretty good  among the things i really liked were the presence of jimmy stewart  he always improves even the most mediocre material  and the incredibly scary looking assassin  who looks like a skeleton with just a thin layer of skin stretched over him   although it cost the studio a lot of money  i didn t particularly care for doris day in the film  she seemed to weep a lot and belts out  que sera  like a fullback  yes  i know that she was supposed to sing in that manner  but this forever made me hate this song  sorry   the other complaint  though minor  i had about the movie was that it was a little  too polished  and  hollywood esque   the original version  also done by hitchcock  just seemed a lot grittier and seedier  and this added to the scary ambiance,1,
the first in a new style of films for lamas  no tattoo s  motorcycles or karate  i  for one  miss them  but this is a serious movie  he plays a fbi profiler who has lived so long with the bad guys in his head that he no longer trusts anyone  including himself  gary busey is either a great actor or somebody i wouldn t want to meet in broad daylight on a crowded street  kristen cloke pursues lamas as doggedly as she pursues the serial killer  there is one surprise after another as the story unfolds not the least of which is the ending  it seems to never come   there is always one more layer to the story  cloke and lamas start out as the good guys  turn into the bad guys and somehow end up the heroes  but it s definitely worth the rental price  for maximum enjoyment throw in a candy bar a bag of popcorn and a soft drink  you re going to the movies,1,
put the film down and back slowly away  the acting rivals a highschool play  the plot is treadworn  and the production values are slightly higher than community theater  the goofs are so plentiful that it becomes a laugher  rooms are switched around  the dead move  dogs are used for wolves  men shot point blank with     caliber pistols are able to walk and ride snowmobiles  blouses button and unbutton without human touch    this is a baaaaaaaaaddddddd movie  i nearly passed out when i saw the average rating  there is no accounting for taste  btw  there is no nudity,0,
tromeo and juliet is perhaps the best shakespeare modernization i have ever seen  not that there s much competition  but anyway     all in all  tromeo and juliet is definitely one of troma s better movies  one of the little pearls hidden in a towering heap of dung  it s a funny  action packed  gory take on the world s greatest love story  but still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as one can except from this kind of movie  well  except for the ending  where tromeo and juliet kill juliet s abusive father  and live happily together in a sunny suburban area for the rest of their lives with their hideously mutated children   this is the movie high school literature classes should show instead of making poor students read through hundreds and hundreds of pages of shakespeare s scripts  thumbs up,1,
the story of how the  communist  leader who freed the congo from belgium imperialism was eliminated by the western powers through the hand of mobutu  a story of struggle and injustice  of hope and the search of freedom  the story could be the one of any african country  a very moving film with images full of symbolism and beauty  if you have to see only one foreign film this year  see this one,1,
if this is not my favorite movie of all time  it definitely is in the top five  i love this  everything about this is perfect  the clothes  the set  the lines  yes  they re not how normal people talk  but    right down to the small scenes  especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes  picking a wedgie  watering the office ivy plant  putting lunch in the fridge    identical to what us office girls do today in the year       i think all the minor characters are wonderful  if someone like joan crawford is over the top  it s all part of the package  if you pick out many things in the movie  it is very evident that this was the beginning of the sixties as women were starting to not  take it lying down   at least not if they didn t want to  as far as characters being contradictory  for instance  suzy parker s character acting like she s all for flings  but then getting too attached to louis jourdan s character  isn t that what many people are like  contradictory  they mix in real stuff with scenes like diane baker s character finding the love of her life after miscarrying her illegitimate baby in an accident  lying in the hospital with a big old bandage around her head  this is part of the package too  it s charm  glossy escapism  i like the mix of real stories pertinent today  the stereotypical career woman who only has affairs with married men  therefore doesn t have a family when she is older  with ones that make you wish   ah  if only i could fall in love with a doctor and he ll love me even though he knows my sordid past  and saw me all messed up after the scandalous accident    also  i just got the dvd  widescreen  it s yet even more beautiful than full screen    yay,1,
i can t believe i bought this movie on dvd  i don t even remember it being shown on tv last year  why in the world couldn t they have just done a real sequel to one of the best christmas movies ever made  damn and randy quaid looks like he s been on the same drugs as jerry lewis  i didn t know about this movie until i bought it tonight and thought i would check it out on imdb and see how it was rated  boy did i make a mistake  if your reading this review be warned stay away from it and just stick to the first christmas vacation  well at least i didn t pay more then    bucks for it  maybe i can trade it in and get half of that back at tower records  then again maybe not  ps i still haven t watched it yet  my dvd player went on the fritz tonight watching another wonderful movie  the chronicles of riddick  unrated director s cut  woo freaking hoo,0,
the quintessential  let s get ready for summer movie   it s dumb  goofy  and maybe a touch dated  but my kids just saw it and they laughed as hard as i did when i first saw it  in the style of all  little guys versus the establishment  movies  so yes  the plot is very predictable  but it s warm and funny  and no  it s not bill murray at his bill murrayest  but he is starting to stretch out in what was his first starring role  odd  though  to see how few of the  fresh young faces  in this film went on to do much more,1,
this movie is simply excellent  for some reason it wasn t a success at the box office in india  in new york  however  i have yet to come across a person who disliked this movie  this is definitely the funniest movie to come out of india  everyone gives a good performance  amir khan  however  just takes over and puts the movie over the top,1,
this movie is excellent   i watched the french version    there are many subplots  which usually detracts from the whole    but they nicely unfold and concur to the  discovering of one s real self  main theme  in fact  the whole movie  besides his background   is the journey to the discovery of one s   or someone else s   self  is the king really a  good peacenik monarch  trying to wage a  war to end all wars  or is he just a disturbed  blood thirsty hoodlum  is he a true king  after all  is the attendant to the queen mother just a lusty  career driven  spineless sock puppet or rather a sharp thinking  bold individual  will the dame concubine realize who the king truly is  what s between the king and the old chancellor  what s the secret everyone knows but won t tell  what s the true reason the assassin quit his  job   subplots  something i m not particularly fond of   are handled well and keep one watching until the end  scenes are well crafted and cgi fits nicely in  without going overboard  suspense is properly maintained and actors are upto the task  there is a lot of brain damaged smiling  but that is how one was supposed to behave at the king s court   as the dame concubine complains about    realistic movie without superhero moments  this chinese movie really puts hollywood cardboard colossals   gladiator etc   to shame,1,
this movie has good intentions  at least in the message  don t be afraid  no matter how tough it can be  fear will kill you in the end  it s a good message  but the container is so flawed that the message gets squashed by bad acting  complete lack of credibility in the feelings  dialog that s delivered as if it were read out loud  stereotypes instead of breathing  living people   it abuses from effects such as slow motion to compensate for a complete lack of credibility in the acting and thus  a lack of emotional force     the suicidal part of it still reminds me of a low budget film from the pre   s  when lesbians seemed to have  at least on celluloid  an utter incapacity of live good  happy lives  and a tendency to get caught in over the top dramas that often involved separation  death  or prison    had it focused on the rewards of living life according to how we feel it  and not according to how others think we should live it   it would have being less dramatic  more inspiring  but it doesn t  it focuses of pain  on loss and leaves the message at just a theoretical ideal   i can t see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection    if you re looking for a really good movie that talks about overcoming fear and daring to live what you feel  go back to the magnificent  desert hearts   even better  read the novel,0,
when the spirits within was released  all you heard from final fantasy fans was how awful the movie was because it didn t seem like final fantasy  this is a different story  for better or worse  the familiar settings  characters  music  story  and over the top action scenes should thrill fans of the original game  the problem is that it just isn t a good movie in its own right   the direction during the fight scenes is often sloppy  switching camera angles ridiculously fast in an attempt to make the action seem more frenetic  but only serving to make the scenes look jumbled and confusing   the cg itself is exceptional  but i can t say it s the best i ve ever seen since spirits within had much more detail on the characters  although i must admit that advent children s characters moved much more naturally   the plot is virtually a black hole  it s a giant deus ex machina designed solely to bring sephiroth back for one last fight  old characters reappear  but serve no real purpose other than to please fans  character development is nonexistent and the film does nothing at all to resolve any of the plot threads left hanging after the game s end  but it s packed with neat looking fight scenes with magic  summons  and limit breaks  which is probably what fans wanted anyway   in the end  advent children is a very flashy  but totally brainless action flick that serves more as a side story for final fantasy vii than a real sequel   by the way  don t think you re hurting my feelings by voting not useful  it just makes me feel superior knowing that fanboys fangirls resent my objectivity so greatly,0,
first of all  i personally adore demons and demons    i saw them although it was hard to find good horrors without good official movie distributing here in russia when i was a kid  and that is an unchangeable part of my boyhood  then i heard nothing about mr bava  then i saw his ghost son  well  it is certainly not a good coming back  why was the leading character  whom we never really knew to at least like him  in accident in the middle of an empty road  why do african servants say so dumb and stupid things about human soul  why is the plot so primitive  haven t we seen enough ghosts for     years of movie production  it is clear that lamberto bava has nothing to show us so far  it is a shame,0,
why do i give this      porn movie   points  because i watched it  and i found it hilarious  aliens  their weird spaceship  their weird helmets    my god  was that a sight  and all what these desperate alien women need is semen from the earth   and where do they look for it  in upper bavaria  germany  and that is where the main fun comes from  in europe  and more so in german speaking countries   bavaria is seen as a traditional and backward region  and then the actors are so helpless with the alien women  well  there have been films about people being unable to deal with women like the  american pie  series   but what this film achieved is a true  funny weirdness  you constantly wonder how they came up with these crackpot ideas  but it was       and looking back    years fills one with a kind of nostalgia  you ve never seen a film like that   and if you don t mind seeing the casual pubic hairs and breasts  watch it once  it is a comedy essentially  not a porn flick,1,
i thought this movie was really good  it ends up showing the viewers in the end that leila should of kept what she had  leila was sick of her husband jim  who was more worried about work then her  he was so into his work that he forgot their anniversary  he was also very sloppy  she couldn t take it anymore so she left to see if he would miss her  the movie shows that he misses her  he even tries to make up for the night he messed up  he goes to her and tries to bring her home  she ends up finding another man named schuyler  he seemed like the man she always wanted neat and notices her  in the end she sorta foreshadows by when she look at schuylers shoes and the way he let his cigar ashes fall on the floor the way jim did the same kinda thing  jim ends off making lots of money and cleaning himself up  leila thinks in the end that she should of kept her husband because thats all she really wanted and he did changing,1,
miles o keefe stars as ator  a loin clothed hero who resembles a chippendale s dancer  the conan wannabe must do battle with an evil guy in a cher wig  and protect the earth from the geometric nucleus  a sort of primitive atomic bomb  watch closely for visible sunglasses and tire tracks  mystery science theater      made fun of it under the title cave dwellers,0,
this could have been a very good film  a very interesting look at ancient tradition and oral history  but it should have been a short subject  as it is   it moves at a snail s pace  sure that s part of the life being portrayed  but this was unbearable  i fell asleep watching them make soup and that was a highlight,0,
as i have said before  i am not a fan of tweety  he s just so aggravating i wish sylvester would just eat him and get it over with   in this cartoon sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans  he spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys tweety is one of the passengers    the ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness  if only for once he s succeed by chewing and swallowing  thus finishing of the irritating canary forever  but  as cartoons starring tweety go  this one is quite good  but it s all thanks to that brilliant cat,1,
the film is visually stunning  from the dusty interior of the church with the lighted stove  through the drizzly street and the run down garage to the blaze that is the climax of the film  it also has a wonderful sense of time  both      s  the film s opening  and      s  all of the performances are top class  especially mathew macfadyen as the psychotic preacher and gerard mcsorley as the father who finds his own intolerance terrifyingly magnified by his son  what a pity  then  that the story is so ridiculous  for a start  in concentrating on the relationship between gabriel  mcfadyen  and his family  it utterly fails to show how he has managed to hold so much influence on the community  in the church  we see five or six of the main characters at the front  and another two or three at the back  but the rest of the congregation might as well be mannequins  they show no sign of hearing him  heeding him or dissenting from him  at the cockfight  nobody says yea or nay when he disrupts the proceedings  but neither does anybody applaud or condemn when caroline throws a pint over him  a situation that results in a stone thrown through the pub window is mysteriously resolved by the onset of labour pains  secondly  middletown  which isn t actually a town  but a tiny village  seems to lack some essential services  such as police and fire service  murder can only be dealt with by a family member with a crowbar  residents watch an inferno that threatens to engulf the whole town as though they were at the cinema  for that matter  everyday things such as telephones and newspapers are conspicuously absent  the rural community is strangely devoid of farm animals or wheat fields  and most puzzling of all for a  typical  north of ireland setting  there is only one christian community   not even a couple of anglicans to season the mix  even if you re willing to suspend disbelief  the story itself is pretty threadbare  a pale imitation of an a j  cronin melodrama  and the music  well  it s beautiful for the first two minutes  but when the same four chords are repeated non stop for    minutes it gets more than a little irritating  my advice  watch this with the sound off,0,
this movie was one of the rolling on the floor laughing movies i have ever seen  danny de vito plays owen perfectly  momma is excellently portrayed  and was one of the highlights of the movie   at the beginning of the movie it starts of differently then what you would expect  larry is trying to write a book and is having some troubles  larry teaches a writing class and owen tagged after larry trying to get him to read his story  owen eventually asks larry to kill his mother  and in return owen would kill larry s ex wife  the whole movie was really hilarious   one of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end when owen writes  throw momma from the train   larry gets furious because he just wrote a book of similar plot  it turns out that owen wrote a children s pop up book   i would really recommend this movie  i gave it a,1,
last night  i got bored and decided to watch a movie called  out kold  which i had once bought with a whole lot of other cheap movies from a videostore  seemed like a good old action movie  so i took out the chips and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening  well  the pain started right from the beginning  the main character is a boxer who is the nicest guy i have ever seen  as the good person he has to be nice of course  but he is just a pussy  that totally doesn t fit with a boxer that has    ko s and starts working for a pimp to earn some extra money  even nice guys can still be cool  well  then came his first fight while he was working for this pimp  every punch was clearly missed and that became even more annoying because the sound effect weren t synchronised with the punches  then there is this totally worthless acting of the whole cast  and you have enough reasons to leave this movie for what it is  i gave it a   because i have never seen such a bad movie,0,
i have never been as surprised by a film that was this old  only  the treasure of the sierra madre  holds up this well  performance wise  as someone that has seen heroin addiction first hand  i was shocked at how realistic this film was  frank sinatra s performance is completely uncompromising  realistic  and heart wrenching  otto preminger s direction is perfect for the film  with long takes and a very mobile camera   kim novak s performance is good  as is eleanor parker s  in fact  the entire supporting cast works very well  with understated performances  as befitting this film s style  the documentary style is part of what keeps this film up to date  highly recommended       out of,1,
when a stranger calls is actually a pretty good movie  i had never saw the original and so when i watched this i thought it was unique  when when a stranger calls was advertised on the television the trailer gave away the ending  well  i never saw the trailer so when i saw this film i was surprised at how good it turned out to be  i walked by it one day and decided i d buy it and now i m lucky i did  because i thought it was a very pleasing movie that is a nice little film to own  it is getting a lot of unfair treatment  and if you re interested in this movie at all  don t listen to all the negativity  camille belle is not as bad of an actress as everyone makes her out to be  and she did a great job in this movie  so all you haters get over yourselves  lighten up  and actually try to enjoy this movie for what it is  a fun  teeny bopper  popcorn flick  if you haven t seen it please do for it is a lot more enjoyable than a lot of the other slashers being made recently,1,
the sequel is exactly what you will expect it to be  and it is good enough that everyone who would have wanted to watch this should leave it happy   this is not a movie that will win an academy award  but it does take what made the jackass tv show and original movie a success  and it turns it up a notch  it is funnier  more brutal  and more disgusting than the original  and i loved every minute of it   the original had a few notorious stunts  and there is at least one stunt that this movie will be remembered for  you will wince  cringe  look away  and laugh very  very hard   in any event  you probably do not need to read this review  or any others  to know if you will like this movie  unless you have never heard of jackass,1,
what has hurt this film is everyone and their aunt matilda is comparing it to its illustrious predecessor  which is always going to hurt any show  if you take it as a western  it s a darned good show  we discover how our characters in  lonesome dove  wind up in the situations they start up in  such as  why do two texas rangers  who live on adventure  wind up in a dead town  and how did gus manage to lose the love of his life   the performances are very good  and we see the exact same mannerisms the characters will have down the road  the actors did a very good job  the cinematography was superb  and while the music didn t live up to the legendary score of nearly two decades past  that was an impossible task  and it was still fine   it also helped that we had three episodes  which you just don t see in a miniseries anymore  heck  it s downright impossible to see a two part telefilm these days   fans of the western  rejoice,1,
after seeing the  oh so acclaimed  fargo and thinking it was nothing more than average  i was wandering if it would be a good idea to rent another coen  masterpiece   this time i was much less disappointed than i was with fargo and i must say that most of the credit for that goes to the good jokes and the good acting of george clooney  well done mr  clooney  make more of these and less  perfect stormish  movies  you can act and you showed it here     out of,1,
let me see   i ve seen every film lou ferrigno has made  i ve seen batman   robin   twice  i ve memorized the dances in breakin     electric boogaloo   i ve watched unfinished blade runner rip off student films   yet this film is the most painful thing i ve ever seen   this was the first movie for the  straight to video market   so you can thank blood cult for all of those mysterious michael dudikoff films at your local blockbuster  you should know that this isn t even high quality video  this is consumer grade  this is you father s video camera he never uses  this is what you have to look at for    minutes   i won t bore you with plot details since i m getting sleepy just thinking about it  but i will tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture  i only watch this movie when i am angry at myself  so i recommend this film if you are suicidal  or if you are up for a mighty challenge   if you happen to rent this film  god have mercy  you will know what you are in for from the first    minutes  this is when you are hit by the usual horror film intro  you know the drill  there s a lot of suspense and build up before some girl dies  yes  you ve seen it before  but not like this  this is the most boring intro i ve ever seen  i honestly believe that you could get a camera off ebay for ten dollars  grab the bum that most smells like gin and candy  and tell him to film your mom cooking dinner and it would be more interesting than this intro  it bored me to tears  i cried like a baby   another one of the things that makes this film so unbelievably painful is its actors  yes  i ve seen bad acting  trust me  i ve seen  th grade productions of oliver twist with more realistic dialog  the lead actor makes me ill  the  supporting  actress is a train wreck of a human   i will not even comment on the boyfriend  true horror   so  rent this movie if you can find it  you ll never be more depressed that you spent   dollars on anything else,0,
milo is a complete rip off of the      slasher flick mikey  if you actually check it up both films have the same tagline but if you want to watch an incredibly funny film with absolutely no plot whatsoever      well then this is the film for you the acting is terrible and the flashback scenes are overwhelmingly confusing  the story behind this atrocity is simple milo jeeder is a kid with serious family problems his father is an abortion doctor who keeps unborn feoutus s in a jar  nice   and was desperate for a child of his own  he figured out a way to bring one of these aborted children to life and he named him              milo       aside from all the bad acting terrible directing annoying sound of milo s voice and the ear piercing sound of the bell on his bike  if you take away all that badness its still a bad but funny attempt at a film   i ll give it a bank busting   out of,0,
i saw this on zone horror and fully expected it to be compete crap like most of the films they play   however i was pleasantly surprised  the film revolves around   friends and a maniac in a monster truck who is chasing them  i know it sounds crap but its actually quite good    the film is creepy when it intends to be and is laugh out loud funny in parts  and not in an unintentional way either  it is well paced and is a lot of fun as well as being very gory   there s some very funny black humour thrown in as well  its not the most original movie but so what  if your after shakespeare then this is not it   if your after a fun movie then this should be fine,1,
this movie is one that belongs on the cutting room floor  for one  the opening sequence does not put forth the element of  gang  related subject  if it wasn t supposed to then at least they got that part right  secondly   whats with all the glancing to the left and then to the right    they even do it in synchronous style  nowhere have i witnessed a member from a rival crew walk up to a bar  look for someone  from the outside lookin like he is all that and a bag o chips at a barbie and walk away without even being confronted let alone get  what for   i wasted money on the rental price and am glad i did not purchase the dvd itself   if this was made by college  t a f e   students then at least they gave it the old aussie try  better luck next time,0,
for many year i saw this movie as a real movie of ninjas but after study more about this culture i can only think this is just another karate film  a black shinobi and some weapons doesn t make a ninja  it s much more than that  the ninja are the most dangerous warrior of the japan because they are trained in every aspect of life to survive to anything  killing whatever try to stop them  this movie is not a about a ninja warrior just about a clown trying to be something he cannot even understand,0,
the thing which makes  fire  even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry  is its touch of femininism and rebellion  to my mind  the very character played by shabana azmi is a symbol of the indian feminine protest against the indian society  the name of the movie and the scene when radha walks through flames in her kitchen are symbloic of hindu mythology s lord rama s wife sita s walking through fire for the proof of her immaculacy  as per the same narrative which appears in the film too  the film could be a great inspiration for women  particularly those in the subcontinent  to search for their liberties and to attain control of their lives,1,
heard about this film a long while ago and finally found it on ebay for five bucks  i wasn t expecting much but wow  was i ever surprised  it s a story of a boy and girl in love trying to escape an evil king who wants the girl for himself and takes place in a huge castle  reminds me of ico for ps  because some shots gave you a sense of vertigo sounds pretty standard but this movie is insane  it s hard to believe such an original animated feature was made in       also  the king was probably one of the creepiest character s i ve seen in a long time  with a feminine walk  weird eyes  usually crossed   and a soft but scary voice  the only problem i had with the film was that the boy and girl had no personality and hardly even any lines except for calling for mr  wonderbird  a large talking green bird to save them  the animation was fantastic in most areas but some cells were missing from some scenes which sucked  it s incredibly original with flying police and giant mechs and even laugh out loud funny at times  it s a real shame this is such an obscure title because it s really a good film  check it out sometime,1,
a real hoot  unintentionally  sidney portier s character is so sweet and lovable you want to smack him  nothing about this movie rings true  and it s boring to boot,0,
especially considering i can count on one hand the romantic comedy films i have ever enjoyed   minnie driver is very good as the heart transplant patient  who has a mysterious connection to duchovny s recently deceased wife   i can think of several awful films which have used this story line  i think there was an lmn movie with jane seymour  this film  however  is a keeper   duchovny is sympathetic  and the scenes with his dog are cute and sad  the dog misses his deceased wife  all of his friends want him to find a replacement  and there is an amusing scene where he is on a blind date and driver is the waitress  his date is horrible  and he finds himself intrigued by minnie driver   caroll o connor is also good in one of his last roles  as the curmudgeonly grandfather  bonnie hunt and james belushi  this is the only film i have liked him in  round out the comedy aspect of the film   this is a good film because the story works  it is not overly romantic  and does not insult the audience s intelligence  highly recommended,1,
a genius  my genius  i remember the exact second in       i was sat in a pub in shropshire  england  i recall the exact seat   bill hicks dies of cancer  said the headline in the nme  i felt like someone had punched me in the stomach  buy this dvd  if you don t find something in it one way or the other i ll be astonished   rip bill  i wish so much you were still here,1,
clint howard  brother of more talented ron  stars in this abysmally awful horror comedy about a mental case who serves ice cream to children and kills people  striving to be a movie that s of the  so bad that it s good  variety  this film misses that mark by a good mile and instead has to be seen as  so bad that it s   well   bad   wheter it s the constant  shoe ad  cinema  the pillow stuffed  fat kid   or the sleep inducing  horror  that soured me on the film  i don t know  all i know is i loathed the film  and this from a guy who has a soft spot for b horror films   paul norman choose to continue making films in the porn industry both before and after this  his only  mainstream  film  a wise choice indeed as horrible acting  nonsense storyline  and ludicrous dialog are much much more palatable while seeing a porn starlet do her thing  funnily enough this turkey has absolutely no nudity  another reason to steer clear    my grade  d,0,
well i have to say i had the chance to see this show here in philadelphia pa sometime in june of    and i really loved it my all time favorite madonna look was the      blond ambition tour era this to me is  madonna  now that she is a mother of   she has to change some things to suit motherhood and i totally agree this is a classic madonna concert i wish  live to tell  wasn t edited we saw body s falling from buildings on     we can see a woman on a cross   any way i m looking forward to the release of this tour on dvd and hope it is the entire show unedited and with a bunch of bonus footage she is a artist of all time the best out there   and still at the top and going strong long live madonna,1,
i hesitated seeing this movie  having really enjoyed the original   mostly martha   what a disappointment  catherine zeta jones is a good actress but this wasn t her film  the original had poignant moments  perfectly punctuated with an incredible soundtrack  no reservations felt like it never connected  the food  the characters   nothing felt passionate  in mostly martha  the food came alive  every scene was filmed in such a way you could taste it with your eyes   the smells  the textures  the food in  no reservations  was in the background   rarely did we get a closeup of the preparation  the characters were not real enough to carry the movie without it  it was hard finishing the movie   many of the scenes felt awkward  see the original   it s a truly enjoyable movie  the soundtrack incredible,0,
i realize it s a small statistical sampling    votes as of this posting   but     out of     i m giving this movie a   and even that s generous  i ve tried to watch this movie three times now  the saturday night   p m  premiere on scifi channel  and the saturday night at   a m  and thursday night re broadcasts  and i ve fallen asleep all three times before the movie ends  which leaves me with a laundry list of unanswered questions  for example  is lance henriksen that strapped for cash that he has to keep playing supporting roles in these god awful  pumpkinhead  sequels  is henriksen contractually banned from doing any non  pumpkinhead  movies  can t the creators of this franchise do better than a monster that looks like a geriatric  emaciated  alien  who walks like he has a stick jammed up his a    when are the hick characters in these movies going to realize that handguns and rifles don t hurt the  pumpkinhead   why don t they try jamming another stick up this thing s a   instead  and  lastly  are the writers of this movie so creatively challenged that they couldn t come up with names for the two feuding families more original than the hatfields and the mccoys  while you re at it  why not write a screenplay about a fictional president and name him george bush  someday i may have the mental stamina to watch this movie all the way through without drifting off to sleep  until then  if somebody has the answers  please let me know,0,
probably the best comedy in a long time  keeps you laughing nonstop  the acting is good and there are a lot of hilarious cameos such as ben stiller as the guitar store guy  the plot wasn t as good as i had hoped but the comedy makes up for that  i can only hope for a sequel cause it seems like they can still do so much more  even though it was   hour and    minutes long i still wanted more at the end    also there is a scene after the credits which is actually one of my favorite parts of the movie   i suggest this to anyone who loves a good comedy and definitely suggest it to fans of the d or jack black  you should buy the album also  the songs are so damn catchy and hilarious  the music on it is top notch as well,1,
this is probable one of the worst movies i have ever seen   the only reason i gave it   stars out of    is the appearance of the gorgeous lydie denier in some of the scenes despite her    years she is an amazing woman in every aspect her nude scene in the bathroom with armand assante is as hot as hell   anyway about the movie well nothing really interesting to say a neonazi and a turkish gang fight over berlin in scenes that include people open firing on the street in daylight and inside a club where       people fire at each other with machine guns in a place no bigger than my house and amazingly after some hours of firing just three die and ten are injured lol   while the gangs fight over berlin terittories a serial killer is killing young children and then dumps them painted white on various places around town   armand assante appears as the turkish detective who although now working for the police was an ex leader for the turkish gang and now is up to solve the serial killer crimes   the movie is obviously a very bad rip off of the classic m movie the killing of the children the involvement of the underworld the character of the serial killer and the ending scene with the  trial  of the serial killer are more than influenced from this classic movie   the acting is terrible the script just stupid the production of the lowest standards possible and in general this was a great waste of time and money   don t even bother renting this one,0,
while this isn t an all time classic comedy it is a pretty good little movie to watch if you catch it on a rainy saturday morning with not a lot else going on right then   harold lloyd plays ezekiel cobb  an american coming home after growing up in china where his dad was a missionary he has come home from china to find an american wife and plans to return to china to continue his father s work cobb unwittingly is recruited to run for mayor of his corrupt home town when the existing political machine that controls the town realizes that he would make a perfect patsy to run against the current mayor who also is the head of the town s underworld they figure the bumbling  stumbling cobb has no chance to win and therefore the current mayor continues to run the town and run his schemes which makes them all rich   lloyd isn t doing the physical comedy here like he did in his silent films he does a convincing portrayal of cobb with a reserved understated dignity the acting was good from all involved and the story and script were also quite good   being made in      the film does have some rather racist language when talking about the chinese and it also has a typical black character from that era but these stereotypes aren t nearly as mean as i ve seen from other films from that time   although not close to being lloyd s best film  this movie does entertain and lloyd is very good as cobb you won t be blown away by this film but it may be enough to peak your interest in lloyd and make you want to see more of his work,0,
my first question  is not about the horrible acting  not about the horrendous writing  it is the directing  the choices that were made about the cinematography are some of this worst decisions i have ever seen  why does every single bad guy have to die in slow motion  i was about to beat myself with a rubber hose  the camera shots make it so that you can t see whats going on  i was just about to turn the movie off because of jalal merhi s accent  when it made it to the sex scene  so i thought it might get better  well it did not  if you rate special effects on an a b c rating scale  i would have to put it around a w or so  and did i mention the acting  wow  was it bad    and the worst part of the entire  expect to die  experience  is the blatant misuse of the phrase on the cover  which is   the matrix just got deadlier   comparing this movie to the matrix is easily the worst comparison i have ever seen  if you haven t seen this movie  don t  unless you are looking for a good reason to beat your head against the wall,0,

there is a fantastic song in killjoy   that goes on about how clowns are usually really nice and fun but killjoy is a killer  i don t recall the song in the first movie but when singer olimpia fernandez sings  killjoy  yeah killjoy    is sounds like the   may have been added in for this dire sequel  the film is much worse than the first movie and that was really bad  this time the cast  including the usually excellent debbie rochon have given up trying and director tammi sutton creates no tension and presents merely a dull and steady film  full moon pictures produced this during their  urban  phase  none of which was very good but none so bad as here,0,
oh my god  after having such a promising start  critters   reiterated the karmic rule of what goes around comes around  clearly  very few things were thought out when this movie was made  and what was up with scott grimes wearing an earing  this should have been the last expedition into the critters saga  but more garbage was on its way  this was the big reason why i didn t watch critters    and why is every bad film series has to have an episode in space   critters  friday the   th  leprechaun in space  hellraiser  etc,0,
a surprisingly good documentary  my surprise was mainly due to the fact that i was confused by the title  i assumed this was about the influence of the drug culture on film making but no it is a much more far reaching and intelligent film than could have been expected  demme has done a great job in encapsulating the period from the late   s to the late   s  from   easy rider  and the collapse of studio influence  through all those introspective  real life  movies  where brilliant young directors tried to express themselves politically  sexually and artistically  through to the beginnings of the blockbuster and the return of the reigns to the money men and their studios  as someone who saw the  real life  movies of britain and the rest of europe through the sixties and then the revolutionary us films of the   s and is sad that the sequel to the sequel is so much the order of the day  this was a most fascinating film  the interview clips are measured  thanks to dvd the full interviews are available as extras   and the film clips well considered  also  as someone who has only just caught up with   joe   i am impressed that this important little film gets its well deserved entry here,1,
so funny is the perfect way to describe this    minutes spoof of the original star wars  hardware wars is incredibly funny  it is presented as the trailer of the space epic hardware wars  the joke is this  imagine star wars played by bad actors and incredibly bad special effects  the characters include the  intergalactic boy wonder  fluke starbucker  the  ace mercenary and intergalactic wise guy  ham salad  darph nader   villain  and a host of other fantastic characters  it is impossible not to laugh as you watch this    minutes treasure  it s stupid but it s fun  you will laugh from the start to the end  and you will feel the need to watch it again  and again  and again  and again    and you will laugh every time you see it        out of     the funniest    minutes ever made  you will believe it lasted a minute,1,
not even original in the plot  ho hum  there were a couple of angles that could have been quite interesting  but the film follows the path of     of hollywood movies  i don t really  get  samuel jackson s acting most of the time in his other films  but he was rather good in this film  he rarely yelled and went much further in his character rather than reverting to an  in your face anger   i liked eva mendes   as usual   and even though she is great eye candy  she proves herself to be much more than that as an actress  luis guzman was actually really good also  except that i disliked the change of his character towards samuel jackson at the end of the film  how can one s character center around a dislike for a former cop and then turn into lollipop land within a split second  is there no original thought left in hollywood,0,
a great cast  a fantastic cgi monster and a brilliant script  if this film had had any of those things then it might not have been amongst the worst films i ve ever wasted an hour and a half on  infinite chimpanzees with infinite typewriters have not yet written the complete works of shakespeare but along the way this has appeared in their waste paper bin and somehow it got made into a movie  you can tell the the actors regret signing those contracts with every word they mutter directly into camera  the cgi is amateurish in the extreme and they might have created more tension of the cast had been attacked with the sinclair spectrum it was created on  i wanted to like this film  it has nice cameo appearances by gil gerard and walter koenig so i expected a fun horror movie that didn t take itself too seriously  it actually does try to take itself seriously but is about as much fun as trip to the dentist  do yourself a favour  don t watch this movie  you ll only encourage them to make more,0,
this movie will not be considered for an academy award  but if you enjoy a movie that doesn t take itself seriously and just wants the viewer to enjoy for ninety mins it is not a disappointment  you ll enjoy a send up of darth vader for the villain  the breather   a female batman for the heroine  but much cuter with much less costume   and a running joke that involves cigarettes and the police captain that s very funny  not by any means a great cinematic achievement  but if you enjoy campy fun it was worth a viewing  god help me  i liked it,1,
overall  this is a pretty bad film  but for    at pathmark  it wasn t a total waste   the whole scenario has to do with a guy who is with this lady infected with snakes  supposedly from a magic curse  the actors actresses aren t names that are big  even though some look like from tv shows   so i won t do my usual troy mcclure thing   for awhile  the film holds your interest as the couple hop a train and travel to l a  to see a shaman to undo the curse  there s a bit of other plots going on too  like two ladies smuggling drugs   but the last    minutes turn out to be a total let down  as violent and gory as the whole film is  the grand finale is just totally computer animated   i saw the unrated version which had tons of language  gore  blood  violence  everything  the bonus features were ok   overall grade  d,0,
a very delightful bit of filmwork that should have had wider distribution  ian mcshane is right at home playing the soul loving dj who gets canned because he won t   go along with the program   and sets out to let the world know what they re missing  the supporting cast is great as well  and the music is the  soul  of the film  i just wish that the film would be released so that i could get a copy of this for my film library,1,
first i am a teenager  ok  and i have to say this movie was pretty good  i think any kid ten and under will like it  but people my age an up might be a little  um  a  well  we d describe the movie as lame  but i liked it  it may be that i still act like a kid  or i visit a cattle farm every weekend  but this movie was cute  i did like how the actors were like kids  not little blonde cutesy pies  wearing three layers of clothes  a trendy hat  and about a thousand assecories  like most shows today  to name a few  drake   josh  lizzie mc guire  well any kid show   and the setting was perfect  but there was a flaw  the family was in debt  right  why in the world did their internal house look like something out of a  western  versace store  that was one flaw   the cameos are great  there s about five hundred of them  and the only explainable one is julia roberts being the main little girl s aunt  how in the world did they get everyone else  this movie seemed to be on a tight type budget   i liked this movie  it was a fun one to watch  and i thought some parts were far fetched  like a cow selling for           ha  my butt a cow sells for that much   but otherwise it was good  i liked it  and i could watch it again  but i d never buy it  there s not even special features on the dvd  what s up with that  but do rent it  especially if you have little kids running around the house,1,
hey if people thought ed wood was a bad director then they totally have not seen this movie  i mean there were gaping plot holes and under utilized cast  shoddy special effects  i mean i cant believe that this movie came out from a hollywood studio  a high school drama club could probably come out with a better product  i mean they had erika eleniak who is gorgeous casper van dien and under rated actor  their agents should be shot to ask them to sign on to this dribble don t they read scripts  i still cant believe that tiny lister was a survivor in the movie i was banging my head the whole time at why him and not a descendant of van helsing be the last man standing  i am a fan of vampire movies and this is by far the worst they should stake it so that it never sees the light of day,0,
this movie was a dismal attempt at recreating a crucial time in english history  the film version of cromwell s growing involvement in the war is marginally accurate but the overall historical accuracy of this movie was way off  this film implies that the war was started over religious differences but the civil war was in no way catholic versus protestant  both sides were protestant  cromwell was never present at the battle of edgehill  nor did he ever  save the day   the royalists did not win  the battle ended in a draw   as another reviewer has noted  cromwell was certainly not one of the  five members  who were to be removed from the house and arrested    overall  this movie was decent  the producers tried way to hard and it didn t turn out so great    definitely could have been better,0,
anna christie         anna christie has some terrific parts  and some amazing performances  and yet it should be even better than it is  it has drama  some of the scenes are really atmospheric  and if the interior shots around the table are a bore  other shots at night and at sea are really pretty exciting  then there are the nearly historical  lively scenes set in coney island  even a brief jittery roller coaster ride   and the episode where two women are behind a netting in separate beds  and visitors to the midway can throw balls to try to tip them over  and the women  scantily dressed  egg the men on is weirdly sexual come on kind of way  all the while garbo  at the front of the crowd  watches   garbo of course is what makes this movie more than just another very good early talkie  she plays all sides of her character  she is coy and skeptical and in some kind of inner anguish  she laughs and cries  withdraws and pushes outward  in some ways it s a forward looking  remarkable movie  directed by clarence brown  who has a whole series of significant films from this pre code sound era    though based on a successful eugene o neil play  it s the writing that struggles a little as the actors seem to go through the paces at times  marie dressler is great in that exaggerated way she almost trademarked  and then there is greta garbo  who really does have a natural presence  even if it seems she s overacting  just slightly  at times  but then  so is everyone else   garbo is of course famous first as a silent actress  and this is her talking film debut  audiences loved her enough that she made a german language version the following year,1,
nothing i dislike more than a kung fu movie that plays for laughs  it is the main reason i can t stand jackie chan  or his lookalikes   he was not always a clown  i must add   my young auntie  is slapstick martial arts of the worst kind  it is a perfect example of how the subgenre was brought down to the mud by endless silly antics and childish behavior  unless you are   year old  i really don t understand how anyone could find this kind of film funny  but humor is indeed a very subjective thing  personally  i think this type of approach did permanent damage to the beloved subgenre  i did think leading lady kara hui was very good here  but i had such a hard time sitting through this one that i could not enjoy her fine performance  if you don t mind all the silliness  you might enjoy it  i know i didn t,0,
as a veteran screen writing instructor at richland college in dallas and a former mgm screenwriter back in the days of decent films  i am thrilled to have accidentally clicked on channel    in dallas tonight and watched this enchanting film in which betty white is gorgeous and makes one yearn for the good old days of truly good movies before hollywood started banging out all this crap for the teenagers  if a producer is listening  i d like to state that there are enough of us over    s who will happily pay a buck to see a movie that has no guns  no killing  no special effects  no sex and violence and just a good touching tale of human relationships that leaves you with a good warm feeling  as this film did for me,1,
eddie murphy and richard pryor team up in this would be comedy about nightclub owners being squeezed by organized crime  eddie murphy wrote and directed this obnoxious ego trip  and therefore has no one to blame but himself for its failure  this is a genuinely bad film  so completely devoid of energy and humor that it serves only as a example of murphy s contempt for his audience  it would be remarkably easy to continue beating up on this movie  but i will show it more mercy than it showed its audience and stop now,0,
i agree with the other   and    star reviews  i saw this at the south by southwest film festival in austin  of the    films i saw   were really good and this was the best one for me  i m a sucker for movies that have plot devices where characters go through transformations that totally change their lives  the excellent acting was mostly done by people involved in tv  or it was their first movie  it was written and directed by jay floyd  this was his debut as a director  jay s day job is apparently as a clearance administrator for lots of famous films  forgiving the franklins was a total delight and extremely funny in spots  this is one movie where i would buy the dvd and re watch it  truly a high complement from me  well done  jay  yes   give up your day job,1,
i ve never been compelled to write a review about anything  but seeing such bad reviews about such an innovative show made me say something  first  people just have to get over the fact that the voices are different  once you watch an episode  it never really comes to mind ever again  the humor is original and while  yes  some jokes do carry over from the movie  they are delivered fresh  some of it is even reminiscent of shrek  self referential humor  a lot of these jokes seem aimed at teens or original fans of the movie as much as tweens and younger  patrick warburton and eartha kitt are both hilarious as they reprise their roles as kronk and yzma and their annie award nominations were well warranted   this show takes some time to love  to really get in  the groove  of things  so to speak  if you ignore the horrible theme song  which really shouldn t warrant that much in the way of how you judge a show since it s only    seconds of the overall product   this show is laugh out loud hilarity and doesn t lose any of the emperor s new groove spirit,1,
after receiving a dvd of this with a sunday newspaper  i hoped that it was not the usual duff films that are given away because no one would ever buy them  i was wrong  sheens acting is on par with that of a ten year old in a school pantomime production and the same goes for the majority of the cast  neill is satisfactory  but plays a russian and isn t helped by his hybrid northern irish new zealand accent  and nor are the rest of the kgb characters  all of whom sound like they re in a cambridge footlights reunion  in fact  the only people with genuine accents are extras who supply an odd word here and there  helpfully letting us know at least where the hell everything is going on in what is otherwise a complete mash  the  espionage  factor is unimpressive for the most part and primarily consists of sheen faffing about in various ridiculous disguises whilst trying to blend into the background  quickly becoming not only boring but laughable  the plot has potential but is completely murdered by the rest of the confusing production elements  this could have been so much better,0,
after a very long time marathi cinema has come with some good movie this movie is one of the best marathi movies ever made  it shows how a old grandfather tries to save his grandsons eye  he tries everything that is possible in his hands to save the child s eye  doctor and a relative of his tries to help him in his attempt   the acting by the grandfather  the boy and the doctor are simply superb  they have shown true picture of a typical marathi life  every bit of action has some meaning in it  i would recommend to watch this movie  as initially i thought this one would be of documentary type but this was above my expectations   this film is really going to touch your hearts i would expect more marathi movies to come up with performances like this,1,
thursday june        pm broadway performance hall   saturday june         pm broadway performance hall  bless the independent filmmaker  without them we d see nothing but spielberg the farrelly brothers and films based on old sitcoms  they are the risk takers  they reap the rewards of success and suffer the failures  max and grace is most definitely a failure  credit is deserved by michael parness for getting out there and making his first feature which he claims drove him to bankruptcy  he might be better off sticking to the stage if this film is any indication of what to expect in the future  even though everyone warned me i went to see max and grace anyway  hoping i might discover something they did not  it starts off well enough  a party for max in his parent s house shot in warm subdued light  the camera floating into interesting angles  as soon as we see max has hung himself  an obvious rip off of harold and maude  the whole thing goes right in the tank  how could he do this unnoticed in the middle of a birthday party  for that matter how could two mentally ill and committed psychiatric patients decide to get married and do it with the blessings of all parties concerned  in the q a after the film david krumholtz suggested the entire story was the surrealist dream of his character max  this story is so badly written the comment sounded more like an excuse  the film doesn t look as though it was made on a shoestring  all the more reason to be so disappointed with the results  what s intended as funny isn t but instead is offensively bad  the continuity is sloppy the lighting is dreadful and the effects look cheap and forced  bph seats under three hundred and was surprisingly full but i saw at least thirty or forty walkouts within the first half hour  at one point grace  played by natasha lyonne  laments her inability to die  i found myself thinking the same thing since i never walk out before the credits  if krumholtz really thinks this is  one of the best scripts  he has ever read it sounds like he needs to catch up on his reading  a terrible waste of talent and resources  this is the worst independent i ve seen since bubba ho tep,0,
emma thompson  alan rickman carla gugino and gil bellows are a delight in this sexy caper  this film is smart  edge of your seat entertainment for adults  and what a relief that is in these days of big concept predictable cartoons  great music and camera work add to the fun that is this new orleans set puzzle  highly recommended  ten stars,1,
the appeal of this film has to be the artsy euro style  because there s absolutely no substance  a bunch of stuff happens that seems to be going somewhere    but it never gets there   it s difficult to come up with a full    lines of commentary  because this film is such a totally empty experience  there s lots of nice photography of a cemetery  some really lame zombie effects  some flashes of what might pass for surrealist humor  and a feeble  existentialist ending  these elements undermine each other  just when you might be enjoying the creepy mood  there s some silliness with bouncing heads or zombie sex  to keep from screaming with boredom  you clutch at the minimal story line   and it disintegrates into ridiculous illogic  it s like someone took several half baked b movies and tossed them in a blender   what comes out is mostly a film  about  meaninglessness   and  not  a good one  clearly  it will impress that category of art house fan who sees emptiness as indistinguishable from depth  everyone else should stay well clear of this dreary mess,0,
there is really but one thing to say about this sorry movie  it should never have been made  the first one  one of my favourites  an american werewolf in london  is a great movie  with a good plot  good actors and good fx  but this one  it stinks to heaven with a cry of helplessness,0,
i saw this movie with my girlfriend  it was a total disaster  you can really see it was cheaply made  badly scripted and with very bad acting  i have read several versions of the book by different authors and also listened to one version on audio book  we couldn t take the movie seriously because of the lacking elements it should have contained  the experience of watching this was like the blair witch visits green acres  then there were parts that were vulgar  they show this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the contents of it  the witch throws the contents of it on the boy and the whole family laughs  i thought it was nasty and very strange  i really can t understand why someone would think that would be entertaining  it shows another scene where dr  mize arrives and betsy bell is urinating in her dress on the steps of their house in front of her mother and brothers  instead of the mother leading her off it is the brother  how sick  the little boy in the first scene of the many scenes dealing with how your body disposes of wastes begs for toilet paper and goes to the out house and makes these sickening faces of joy with sound effects  i think they should have left all of that out  the makeup on the reverend james johnston as a older man didn t really make you assume he was older  it made you think he was dipped in fish batter  the blood on joshua gardner when he falls from the ladder is even worse  the john bell death scene looks like they got out flour and tried to do something with it to make him look as a serious sick man  to me to much sickening comedy with bathroom problems and inexperienced people involved was the downfall of this picture  these people would do better if they film commercials for local tv stations for bathroom products  they chose a good subject and were unable to produce it in a correct manner  i rate this film capital f minus,0,
i also made the mistake of thinking that i was going to see the      swimming upstream with geoffry rush  this was worse then a lot of student films that i have seen  the script was forced  the acting was subpar and the editing annoying  it was so slow that i just managed to force myself into staying  but i always give a movie a chance  so i suffered until the very end  apparently there was a memo out about this movie  because my friend and i were the only ones in the theater  why didn t somebody send me this memo     that is why i m posting  as a warning to others thinking of shelling out good money to see this  i just hope that you actually got to this page  and didn t get trapped like i did by looking at the wrong  swimming upstream   p s  sorry to the cast and crew if you are reading this  i know that you worked hard to make this  i know what goes into making a movie    keep trying,0,
i saw messiah   a few months ago and didn t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel   okay it s not a million miles away from the plot of seven but it s still compelling   much of my praise has to do with ken stott s performance as dci red metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret   it d be easy for stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way   likewise the murders are very shocking but   unlike the sequel where the murders are carried out onscreen in a rather ott manner   there s actually little violence shown    my only criticisms are that the red herring was too obviously a red herring which meant i wasn t taken in by the shock twist   and you would probably see the shock twist coming so i won t bother with a spoiler alert   and that when the real murderer was revealed it seemed both slightly far fetched and caused a few plot holes to appear in the story   if i remember correctly the sequel had similar problems once the murderer was revealed so maybe it d be a good idea not to make messiah,1,
a young frenchman uproots himself as he becomes an erasmus exchange student in barcelona and comes back a better man  sounds boring  no way  the movie is filled with colourful people  all of them stereotypes  the british twat and her racist brother  the sexually liberated dane  the ultra organised german       in this case though  the stereotypes are brilliantly done  you feel like you know people like that  i for one know an arrogant doctor and his trophy wife  and they re just like the characters in the film    they feel like real people    go see this movie and enjoy the subtitles,1,
i think i was recommended this film by the lady in the shop i was hiring it from  for once she was bang on  what a superb film  first of all i was convinced james mcavoy   romola garai were irish so convincing were their accents  and by half way through the film i was utterly convinced steven robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure james mcavoy was also  when i watched the special features on the dvd and saw both actors in their  normal  guise  to say i was blown away would be an understatement    i can remember all the acclaim dustin hoffmann got back in the    s for his portrayal of autism in the film  rain man    quite frankly  in my opinion of course  steven robertson s performance portrayal blows dustin hoffmann s right out of the water   and he deserves recognition as such   all in all one of the greatest portrayals of human friendship love relationships ever   and it was made in britain ireland with home grown actors   stick that in yer pipe and smoke it hollywood,1,
i just watched  return from lonesome dove  and it was very good  i ve seen a lot of negative comments about it and i don t think the viewers are being real about it  in the television  movie business it is hard to get all the actors back for a  nd sequel or  rd part  we are lucky to have another miniseries that ties into lone d  faithfully   this production was top notch with the original music score  and the actors put their hearts into it you can tell   if you want to watch lonesome d  with robert duvall and tommy l  j  then watch the original  return to l d  didn t have as much wit and takes on a more serious tone but is totally captivating none the less  from the touching moments to the villains  this one is a winner   wonderful,1,
i don t see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor  you need to get your head out of your up tight ass if you don t find this movie hilarious  if this isn t your  cup of tea   so to speak  then look at it for what it truly is  a damn funny movie  maybe they did set out to make yet another drugs t a movie  but in this case  they ve truly hit the spot  it s especially funny for the ali g fans  because he delivers everything we ve come to love and expect from him  so i say big ups to ali g  and if it s not your thing  don t whine  batty boy,1,
i guess there are two ways to make a movie with kids as the intended audience  you can either say to yourself a   let s make a movie that kids today will love   or b   let s make a movie that i would have loved when i was a kid   the second approach explains why steven spielberg often make movies that appeal to a younger audience  prime examples are e t   the goonies or indiana jones  that darn cat is an example of the first approach  you see these flat  unbelievable characters saying things that is supposed to be funny but isn t  the plot itself is enough for a ten minute short  but instead it goes on and on  and although i m not a kid  i don t quite understand what in this movie is supposed to be fun for kids  the clumsy cops chased by a dog  the old lady with a tweety bird or christina ricci s sarcastic oneliners  one actor showed a spark of talent with his very acrobatic humour  doug e  doug playing the fbi agent,0,
s the bourne identity is one of my all time favorite movies  however  many fans of the book have complained that the movie had very little to do with the book s plot   the assignment is the real deal  it s odd that no one on the  bourne identity  threads has mentioned this movie at all   well  i jst did    besides the excellent plot  i personally found this movie to be as good as any espionage movie i ve ever seen  with the possible exception of the bourne  identity itself   the action is all completely realistic  i especially liked the protagonists  training regimen  which was very inventive   the feel is dark and gritty  there are a few surprising plot twists  the acting is excellent    if you like this genre  i cannot recommend this movie highly enough,1,
on first viewing this movie seems to be some kind of fairy tale about a beautiful and significantly white horse once seen never forgotten  however viewed strictly within the context of the story the implication is that to survive in the immediate post civil war america  one had to have a horse  and not any old horse but a truly great one  and eagle s wing is such a horse  but for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter  who should own it  the native american or the awol soldier  the story throughout pits primitivism against civilisation  as has been said by other commentators it is ironic that it took an english director to perceive this fact  and then develop this simple theme into a western like no other you re ever likely to see again  the film is basically about this beast and the savage harshness of the environment and the people who scrape a living from it  the photography and the soundtrack are exquisite  martin sheen s performance is a revelation  this film  released in the same year as sheen s other great performance as willard in  apocalypse now   hints at his abilities which somehow were never given such a free rein again  more s the pity  a comparison of the two stories throws up the surprising similarities between them   not least that both films chart a man s journey into his soul in order to find redemption  whereas willard is redeemed i will leave it to the viewer to decide if pike is eventually  the ending is fabulous in the true sense of the word  and very moving  be warned  altogether this is an extraordinary film,1,
you get an hour and a half of braindead i have to save the world action all the way  one liners and a woman somewhere in the equation  this time he plays a guy who help people in the witness protection program  to quote the cover of the movie  he erases their past to save their future  woppi  this have to be cool    i bet younger people will like it though but it is a little over the top for my taste  and the one liners are really something else  and i don t mean that in a good way  after killing a crocodile he manage to say   you re luggage  if you are in the right mood you may enjoy the movie  and as far as braindead action go  this is not very bad  but almost before the movie starts you know exactly what is going to happen  but if you like these kind of movies  you will probably enjoy this one  i rate this movie,0,
one of the best lackawanna blues  great movie great cast great music this is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another    minutes i will w atch this one many times    this is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature  the cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role  you get the sense that you re really there taking all this in  a great deal of care was given in the sets  costumes and music of the period  the relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the movie goes on  but the steady performance of ms  merkerson is so powerful that the movie ends before we ve had our fill of the wonderful misfits  to single out anyone other than  nanny  is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors including   jeffery wright  jimmy smits  terrence howard and delroy lindo  but it is marcus franklin  macy gray and ms  merkerson that makes this a wonderful experience   the movie moves rapidly and is short by todays standards  but it is without question one of the best movies you re going to see this year  if you like good period pieces that will challenge you emotionally  tug at your heart  lift you joyfully and have you tapping your feet at the same time  then this is the movie for you  i ve shown it to several friends and they all want my copy  that says it all  the movie is that good  check it out for yourself   danceability    amsterdam holland,1,
for all of us american deneuve fans  this little gem is a little tough to get ahold of  fortunately  i found myself so wrapped up in the short bits that i saw previewed on youtube com that i was willing to go to any lengths  i found it on ebay com  ordered it directly from france  and changed my laptop so it would play region   dvds  let me tell you that it was well worth it  be warned   there are no subtitles  unforunately  pathe shouldn t have released this on dvd  koch lorber should ve   they re good about the subtitles   i don t speak a word of french  i can utter a syllable here and there  order a drink and whatnot  that having been said  this film was a treat anyway  i couldn t fully appreciate the supposed  bawdy  humor or the witty dialogue  watching deneuve and her cohorts was enough for me  i understood what was going on without need of the dialogue  it really says something about a film when those who can t speak the language enjoy it    the cinematography is wonderful  london is adorable as the smitten son on law  loved the lesbian mom  and  of course  what can i possibly say about our dear mademoiselle deneuve  she is one of a kind  those eyes  that smile  i could watch her films all day  she really goes beyond beauty  people always say she s gorgeous  well  yes  she is  but she is also very talented  i believed her every second of the way  her conversation about chocolate and vanilla with london is too sweet  her character even gets arrested for smoking dope with some    year old in the street  not to be missed  fly to france and buy this if you have to  great,1,
i read the book written by bill carter on which this movie is based many years ago  the book is certainly stronger than the movie  it provides more detail than a movie can possibly provide  the end result being that i thought the movie seemed a wee bit sketchy on a handful of items  all things considered  though  and given the limitations of the medium  the movie provides a wholly entertaining and informative account of the battle between jay leno and david letterman in the early    s to host  the tonight show  after the retirement of johnny carson   the highlight is clearly the performances  i can think of no more difficult performance for an actor than to play a character who is still alive and well known and on tv on a regular basis  john michael higgins nailed the part of letterman perfectly  watching him really was like watching letterman  daniel roebuck tried valiantly to be jay leno  but somehow didn t pull it off as effectively  his whole  look  seemed fake  and he just didn t seem natural in the role  in a less central role  rich little not surprisingly nailed the voice of carson  although the look was a bit off  in the book  the most interesting of the central figures was probably leno s agent  helen kushnick  in the movie  kathy bates was perfect in the role  although not quite as out of control as carter s portrayal of the woman in writing   in the end  this is light and entertaining viewing  the subject matter isn t especially important in the overall scheme of things  but it s a fun behind the scenes look at a memorable time in the entertainment industry,1,
that s pretty much all i can say about this flat and uninspired remake of the      carol kane vehicle  camilla belle isn t much of an actress  and she brings no energy and vitality to the role of jill johnson  the babysitter harassed by an anonymous phone caller   but if you re looking for some great home architecture and interior design ideas  this movie provides more inspiration than anything you ll see on tlc or hgtv  jill spends nearly    minutes wandering through the house of the rich doctor and wife for whom she s providing her sitting services  searching for the origins of strange sounds and things that keep going  bump  in the night  as she lurks around corners and peers down hallways  we get to see a beautiful master bathroom with his and hers sinks that look like roman tubs  a huge kitchen with incredible back lit glass shelving  and the piece de resistance  a self contained aviary and coy pond that feature a self watering system   because the movie isn t compelling enough to draw us into jill s fear  we re distracted by the grandeur of the house  which isn t something you should be doing when you re watching a thriller  even as jill is pursued by the faceless maniac  we cringe because she s breaking valuables and messing up the coy pond  not because she s about to get murdered   the movie plods along as predictably as most teen slasher movies  and the ending is anything but original  by the time it was over  i just wanted to find out where the heck that house was and if it was real  never mind jill and the kids she was babysitting     stars   both for the house,0,
so where s my friggin trophy  i seriously expected a banner and confetti to drop from my ceiling for watching a full    minutes of that crap  comedy central is truly dropping the ball lately  trying to fill the void left by chappelle with multiple seasons of a retarded man impersonating retarded men  dah duh nah   if you pay attention to the show  you ll notice that when mencia isn t stuttering over punchlines and laughing at his own skits  he only makes exaggerated observations which seem to lack any sense of humor  you ever notice how people in buick s drive really slow  it s like dah duh nah  not even the midgets and half naked hot chicks manage to distract from mencia s distinct lack of talent  furthermore  mencia isn t even a  wetback  as he constantly and adamantly proclaims he is  which makes him a fraud on top of it all   if anything good could be said about mencia  it s his effort  the man clearly has no talent  but like a wounded antelope in the mouth of a hungry alligator  god knows he s trying,0,
the submarine used was not varangian   it  was in fact two boats  p    and p     both built for turkey by vickers armstorng at barrow in furness but kept hold of by the royal navy for the duration of the war  p    was sunk but p    was eventually delivered in         the confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up p    as i did  and found varangian  when in fact  the last digit of both p    and p    was in fact just painted out      there are some extremely realistic moments in the film  these turkish boats were very similar to the s class  as no s class submarines survive  the shots of them  as p    and of the depot ship  forth  form part of an interesting record now  as well as an excellent film,1,
quite a lot has been said about this film and its landmark importance in forming the language of film  if you are interested in film history  to truly understand the innovations eisenstein brings to the medium you might try viewing potemkin along side most any film made before it  those of d w  griffith offer a good contrast   it should be allowed that eisenstein was not the only montage theorist and the principles of montage editing would likely have been discovered by another given time  however  even today  few directors have approached the skill with which eisenstein created meaning through the combination of images at such an early point in the evolution of the medium   if you are not interested in that sort of thing  potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made  you should see it  buy it  and tatoo it to your chest,1,

chupacabra  dark waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made  i had expected at least some passable entertainment because john rhys davies was involved  and after seeing this movie  i can honestly say i lowered my opinion of mr  davies substantially   why  the acting is incredibly poor  an excellent actor like davies should have demanded more from the cast and the director  it was painfully obvious that mr  davies was just clock watching and hoping the check would not bounce  to say that he just showed up would be an understatement  but at least he did show up  the rest of the cast looks like they mailed it in from their respective jobs at the various los angeles restaurants where they work as waiters  talk about a cast of unknowns  this is the kind of cast that never appears in movies again  they act as if they were auditioned while waiting at the unemployment office   what about the special effects  store bought firecrackers  styrofoam  a cheap rubber suit and cgi effects that look like they came from my      atari game  i have seen some horrible special effects used on sci fi channel movies  but this stuff looked like cut and paste done at the kindergarten by someones  child  i expected mr  crabs and sponge bob would show up at the end to battle the chupacabra  not to mention that all the accounts of the creature describe it as a small gremlin like critter  it would have been a good film for a leprechaun like character  instead  we get a gigantic hulking creature that is shown walking with stop action speeded up effects that are laughable  the chupacabra is in one place and then it shuffles at super speed down the hall and it is worth a few laughs just to see this,0,
one of starewicz s longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange  the dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold  but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters  with the help of a stuffed cat  the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death  the mascot features new techniques i have not yet seen in starewicz s films  the addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop motion animation makes for a new twist on starewicz s old style of puppetry  live scenes of moving cars and people s feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh  the honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and starewicz s utilization of the new technology seems like old hat  new puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devil s club scene  twigss and newspaper shreds come to life  skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks  characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses  a new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene  overall  starewicz is able to update his style of film making to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work,1,
the biggest heroes  is one of the greatest movies ever  a good story  great actors and a brilliant ending is what makes this film the jumping start of the director thomas vinterberg s great carrier,1,
blind date is one of three stories made into movie by author vida hurst  lots of familiar faces in this oldie from       mickey rooney as a mouthy little punk  he seems to be in the film for comedic and homey  family values   jane darwell again plays the strong willed mother  just as she had in grapes of wrath and the oxbow incident  ann sothern is kitty  who has been dating bill  paul kelly   but meets up with rich bob hartwell  played by neil hamilton  who may or may not be better for her  you can certainly tell that this was made at the very beginning of the hays production code    at one point  kitty says she can t be up there alone with him if there isn t anyone else in the house   what a change from just a year or two prior  when anything and everything was ok  good solid plot  but a whole lot of conversation and mushy love talk  it raises the question over what a girl should be searching for in a man  should she hold out for a man with integrity who treats her nice  or just find a man with big bucks  as most of the movies from the previous    years had advocated     and how do men change when their situation changes   watch out for some violence in the strange dance marathon scene  tv viewers from the     s will recognize hamilton as commissioner gordon from batman      also some weird drama in the off screen lives for some of the cast in this one   paul kelly had gone to jail for being accessory to murder in a love triangle  mickey rooney had an affair with norma shearer  who was    years older  rooney ended up being married eight times  tyler brooke  emory  and spencer charters  pa  both knocked themselves off in real life  the title  blind date  has been reused many times  for films  tv series  and even cartoons  but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one,1,
the film is a gross misrepresentation of orthodox lifestyle and practice  never will a jewish court enforce a divorce between childless couples  although the concept exists in jewish law  the conditions are too numerous for it to actually ever take place  childless couples do find it difficult to cope with their childlessness in a community where children are a very important part of life  but nowhere are they  rejected  by their community as depicted in the film  they are treated with extreme sensitivity  in fact  many great rabbis have lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce   the depiction of yosef  a horrible human being  is meant to   perhaps subconsciously   show the behavior of a typical orthodox male  in reality  it is as typical as a violent drunkard rapist is typical of secular society  both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable   it is surprising that so many people form their opinions about a society based on a movie  by someone who is personally biased against a community   i have always thought that it is only the orthodox  because of their narrow mindedness and insular lifestyle  who judge all secular people based on the violence and immoral conduct they read about in newspapers or see in the movies,0,
a throwback to the  old fashioned  westerns of the   s and   s  such as dodge city   dallas has a number of things going for it  gary cooper at his coolest  blazing technicolor photography by ernest haller  gone with the wind  and a pulse pounding max steiner  king kong  gwtw  dodge city et al   score  in addition  there is a masquerade  mistaken identity  a faked death and more hair breath escapes than a republic serial  as always  cooper defines what it is to be a man under pressure  forget the   s angst western    this is pure entertainment,1,
this is an excellent tub thumper from the war years   john mills leads a fine cast of regular british b movie stalwarts in a solo submarine attack upon a fictitious enemy battleship   filmed in black and white  it s well paced and also well placed considering that a war was going on at the time  if anything  it shows how seriously the authorities took positive propaganda   the mission side of the movie takes place in genuine submarines  things are cramped and claustrophobic  the actors look suitably grimy and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic palate  other commentators have already drawn attention to the authentic little details like keeping the vessel trim and forgetting to read instruments  as well as the engine room activities   this probably is the first movie in which debris  and a dead german  is blown from the torpedo tube to fool an enemy destroyer  and it s the only time i have seen part of the vessel exposed in a pretence of sinking   a high risk gamble if ever there was one   i m a little sceptical as to whether or not a submarine could punch its way through a wire rope net  submerged speed was barely twice that of human walking speed  and the net would have had a great deal of  give   also  the engineer was at the same work station and operating the same levers both on the surface and submerged  this  too  seems implausible as either diesel or electric engines were used and they were in different sections of the ship   or so i m told   there was a wee bit too much shore side drama for my tastes  but then  this was a propaganda effort  and clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to mind their behaviour as it could adversely affect service morale and therefor the war effort   these niggles aside  it s a pretty entertaining little adventure  nowadays movies of such vintage tend to be screened in the afternoon  whilst far more modern and inferior movies enjoy prime time  but then  it s no longer politically correct to mention the war in the presence of our european friends  too many of them have guilty consciences   or our own left wing fascists  non of whom have ever fought for the freedoms they now take for granted    as a submarine movie it is eminently collectible  better than  the enemy below   i think  though less demonstrative  not so authentic as  das boot  by any means  but not so gross either,1,
i would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie  if at one point or another you thought you ve seen good camera work  be prepared to be amazed by this movie  for the record  this movie was made in      in russia  but the technique used here is probably something that we ve seen much later in the western world   about    years later  the level of emotions through the film varies quite a lot  happiness  love war  despair joy  but in the end you remain with something quite unique  the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking  the young directors from our time should study more this kind of movies and maybe they will be able to create something similar  even though i think movies like this are very hard to come by    if you ve seen  i am cuba    then this movie would appeal to you very much  but if not  be prepared for a unique experience  the russian directors have something in common  very small budgets  great actors  and a joy of creating art   and yes  they are able to create more masterpieces than all the western world together  i am not a big fan of russia  actually i hate everything that s communist  but the film making in that part of the world  manages to create such feelings that are hard to describe   enjoy it,1,
one of the intriguing aspects of this historical drama is the way the  tories  or british american loyalists are portrayed  and the sort of gloss given to their ardent support for king george iii  in many ways the american revolution was definitely a family affair  in that some of the wealthier colonial families were split asunder by it  if there is a strong criticism to be made of this film  it is that perhaps the people in this story are made out to be a little bit nicer than they were in real life   in some regards  the actions of the character of major boulton  played by cornel wilde  make him the least likable member of the cast and the flaw in the storyline  he seems to vary from being a prickly kind of patriot to being a kind of  anything for the cause   fellow  this film does concentrate heavily on the notions of personal honor and personal prestige which were a major social  norm  in that day and age   in its subtext  the fact that about twenty five percent of the colonial population was decidedly pro british is glossed over  too  but the strength of the tory element is not obviously maligned  although the good doctor character is about eighty five percent upper class twit   to steal a fine phrase from monty python s flying circus    anne francis does a whole lot with a rather thin section of the script  and it stands out  she was a good choice for the woman of divided loyalties  a  gal  who was rather more modern than the social conventions of that day might have allowed    if there had not been a life and death struggle going on   one good aspect of the film is the way the rivalries of the american revolutionary leaders degenerated into outright jealousies  and how these personal conflicts very nearly sabotaged the entire revolutionary effort  all in all  the leading characters are very well drawn  the minor characters are not just human  props  and the fight scenes are believable enough to carry the dramatic action   this is a great spy movie  it s not quite a great historical drama  but it does satisfy well enough  it rates a seven largely because cornel wilde is so deeply immersed in his role  and does it so well  and because anne francis makes the most of her supporting effort   the color print used on turner classic movies was very clear  as well  and so it was an enjoyable presentation in that important regard   hope it runs again soon,1,
being a bit of a connoisseur of garbage  i have stumbled across this little treasure  action  romance  crooked cops  violence  its all here and not a single one has been pulled of right  i was in love immediately  then  a funny thing happened about the second time around  i became addicted  i thought it was going to be a one rent and chuckle kind of movie   rudy ray moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie  he didn t have the money to make it look good  but he did it anyway  that s very commendable  it also shows he was making the movie for his self  i don t know how many of you have heard rudy ray s music  but if you haven t he has a whole slew of albums reaching into the fifties,1,
walking with dinosaurs is absolutely brilliant in every regard  kenneth branagh narrates in a way that really makes you want to listen  the script for the documentary really sounds as though the researchers and writers had done their homework  it is so insightful and it does get you hooked and never lets go  the music is also brilliant  very dramatic when it needs to be  but the visual effects and scenery are what makes this documentary work so well  the scenery is breathtaking  and the dinosaurs look so real  thanks to the simply astounding effects  this is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but kids too   in conclusion  this is a must watch  not only did i love this  but this is quite possibly the best documentary i have ever seen  if anything  it could have done with being longer  other than that this is perfect        bethany cox,1,
korean  romance  about the owner of a camera store who is diagnosed with a fatal disease  as he goes about his daily routine and prepares for the end he becomes acquainted with a young girl who is a customer  a friendship and romance grows  eve though neither expresses any sort of affection for the other  good film is unlike anything you are likely to see remade in america simply because the studios would insist that the  couple  act on their feelings  he will not say anything because he doesn t have that long to live  she won t because its not the thing thats done and he is not responding as she thinks he should  of course its much more complex than i m making it out to be and in all honesty its the sort of thing that you should discover for yourself  is it a great film  no  but it is a good one that will move you emotionally  the final lines of the film still haunts me   i always knew that love would fade like a photograph   but you will remain in my heart as you are in my last moment  thank you and goodbye   it may seem odd out of context but with in the context of the film it is very moving,1,
acting     script     hurlyburly  is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared anything resembling a story or plot is forbidden  while people may get away with this on stage  on film it becomes deadly    or at least deadly dull  we re left with a bunch of great actors spouting dialogue that  while brilliantly written  adds up to nothing  even worse  every character speaks with the same voice despite their backgrounds  the only attempt to differentiate is to have teen waif anna paquin use the word  ain t    never mind that the characters are unsympathetic losers to the extreme  the camera work is plain sloppy and  for la residents  the attention to geography is laughable   hint  the view out sean penn s front window is about eight miles away from the view out his back window  and you can t drive south through hollywood and wind up in glendale pretending to be burbank   okay  suspension of disbelief and all that    and normally i wouldn t pay attention to little things like that  because they are just vagaries of production  but  the fact that they did stick out so much despite the thespian pyrotechnics on screen says a lot about the weakest element of this enterprise    the script   in short  skip this one  even on video  rabe picked the wrong quote from the scottish play for his title  hurlyburly would have been better named  a tale told by an idiot  full of sound and fury  signifying nothing   a bit long for the marquee  perhaps    but at least it would be honest advertising,0,
this might be for those who have been to summer camps  but it sure isn t an entertaining camp  i went to one before  but it didn t make me scream up and down for joy  instead  it made my head hurt   the first thing you notice is that bill murray actually had some hair in the   s  yeah  and he also didn t mind running some  but to get him to run a lot  you would need to give him a woman to chase after   its not that some of the stunts can t be funny  for example the running joke with one of the councilors who is always waking up somewhere else due to the movement of his bed  instead  its that the jokes and stunts were poorly setup and executed  it just failed to be funny   to somebody who loves comedy  this is a pain  others are glued to it for life  i wish it was more like leonard part    but it doesn t come close   f,0,
horrible script  which was apparently directed by   no one  the marines can t fend off the monster with machine guns  however it backs off when a    year old girl karate kicks it in the face a few times  it s supposed to be a luxury liner  but the fancy dining room looks like a cafeteria in a hospital  it appears that they rented a high school for the summer  and pulled out chairs and stuff to decorate the set with  in the end shot  they are pulled from the water and into a boat and less than   seconds later they are apparently about two miles from the ship as it sinks how do movies like this get made  i guess anyone can be in a film these days  aaron james  nyc,0,
i just saw this on a local independent station in the new york city area  the cast showed promise but when i saw the director  george cosmotos  i became suspicious  and sure enough  it was every bit as bad  every bit as pointless and stupid as every george cosmotos movie i ever saw  he s like a stupid man s michael bey  with all the awfulness that accolade promises   there s no point to the conspiracy  no burning issues that urge the conspirators on  we are left to ourselves to connect the dots from one bit of graffiti on various walls in the film to the next  thus  the current budget crisis  the war in iraq  islamic extremism  the fate of social security     million americans without health care  stagnating wages  and the death of the middle class are all subsumed by the sheer terror of graffiti   a truly  stunningly idiotic film,0,
this was my late wife s favorite film  i m sorry she did not live long enough to have the video as i m sure she would have worn it out  what can we say  a great romantic story and the push off of two great men  the raisuli and teddy rex  sean connery and brian keith are great in these roles  but while connery is his usual sexy sex  it s the late brian keith who gives us a solid performance as the mercurial teddy roosevelt  back up is provided with candy bergen  gorgeous in her early   s  as the kidnapped american widow  great back up also comes from the great john huston as teddy s beleaguered secstate  john hay  geoffrey lewis  from the clint eastwood films is great as the hesitant us ambassador  gummere  the late vladek sheybal with his demonically evil stare is great as the beshaw and more is given by steve kanaly and roy jensen whose faces we have seen in several backgrounds  all in all  this is a film filled with wonderful romance  mindful of an era long gone  mindless story  not at all  the issue of big nations pushing around smaller ones for their own hegemonical interests is as true today as it was then  overly romantic  not really   certainly not maudlin in any sense  fun to watch  you bet  i own the video and will watch it again and again  i suggest you do the same,1,
every sunday is an eleven minute short subject featuring the talents of two of its young juvenile contract players  a pair who would develop into players of note in the future  it s interesting and entertaining to see the contrasting styles of judy garland and deanna durbin as they perform at a sunday concert for deanna s uncle   of course no one knew how big both of these young ladies would get to be  i ve always wondered why mayer kept garland and let durbin go to universal  l b  always had pretensions to culture and this was the guy who had jeanette macdonald at his studio and later on hired such lovely soprano voices as jane powell  ann blyth  doretta morrow  etc   judy certainly had her glorious career at mgm  but she paid a heavy price for it  deanna  along with abbott costello and several gothic horror monsters preserved universal pictures  she was smart enough to get out at the top and make it stick   so  in their salad days  deanna durbin and judy garland,1,
wow  i just have to say this show is super cool  i fell in love with the show from the beginning  the idea of the show is very original and very soothing  it s also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give  lauren graham and alexis bledel  they re simply wonderful  i m especially a big admirer of lauren graham  she s not just a pretty face  she s a  monster  of an actress as well  i m not saying that alexis isn t a wonderful actress as well    i just happen to like lauren better  anyway it s a real delight seeing them on screen   sparing  with words  in the words of the immortal jim carrey  b e a utiful,1,
got back from morocco then  where my dad was attached to the german embassy  when the film came out in europe  took all my girlfriends to see it  show them the beauty of the country  where jimi had played   and stayed    where the hippies stopped after leaving ibiza and before joining goa  sean combs just celebrated at a friends restaurant in marrakech recently  the djema el fna was much wilder in those days than it is now  the stones went there earlier  brian recorded in tangiers   so it s memories and family entertainment and i m glad my son will get to know about the north of africa watching this movie  candice bergen looks beautiful and oo  connery is pretty funny indeed  and teddy roosevelt as played by brian keith quite impressive,1,

tnt jackson isn t completely unwatchable  but either the version i saw on dvd was edited with a weed whacker  or the screenplay itself is the lowest level of grind house blaxploitation sausage  or maybe both   jeanne bell is supposed to have been a playmate at one point in her career and the movie makes the most of the connection by displaying her breasts at least two times more than was really necessary  including a hilarious topless fight scene that i am pretty sure was meant to be funny   i will admit  they are quite nice  still  she s sort of average looking and doesn t have the charisma of a foxy brown  of even a cleopatra jones  she does have her moments as an actress in the film  though  but it would have been nice if the director had pushed her a little harder or the screenplay had given her a chance to do more than emote  attitude  and kick people   speaking of kicking people  the fight scenes  the other putative reason to watch a film like this  are pretty poorly done there s no real choreography to speak of here  just people posing and sticking feet and fists in the general direction of their opponents  one minor exception is a nice moment with an opponent equipped with butterfly folding knives  another is a sequence near the very end where an obvious stunt double for bell  and maybe for stan shaw  leap around and do some decent sweeps and groundwork for a minute or two before bell  jackson  punches her enemy s liver out  shaw collapses and the screenplay just stops   again  i will admit that this is very much in the tradition of shaw brother quickies since time immemorial    there are a couple of supporting actors who are actually better than the film deserves  i m thinking of  joe  and the fellow playing the drug lord s right hand man   there s a halfway decent funk laden soundtrack that complements the action on the screen and add a star to the rating by itself  there s a semi dodgy sex scene that manages to be effective almost in spite of itself   this one is strictly for hardcore fans of blaxploitation  i saw it out of sheer curiosity  and i m not sorry i took the time  but i can t imagine wanting to take the time to see it again unless i decide to write a dissertation on the pop culture intersections of  kung fu theater  and  foxy brown,0,
film follows four friends from the     s  when they re in high school  up to       they are danilo  craig wasson  a yugoslavian immigrant  georgia  jodi thelan  a  free spirit   david  michael huddleston  who has no personality and tom  jim metzler  a big  strong  handsome  rugged guy  all three of them are in love with georgia but she only loves danilo  the film mostly focuses on those two  it chronicles their lives  love and attraction to each other over the years  it also gets into danilo trying to win the love of his tough immigrant father    i love this film but it s not without its bad points  thelan s high  squeaky voice is annoying  but you get used to it   the story jumps around very quickly  tom and david s lives are never explained  tom shows up with a vietnamese wife and kids and david has a wife we never meet until the end   some crucial scenes are badly written and there s some obvious pre release cutting  probably to keep the film at   hours    but everything else is so good you can easily forget the problems  the story is compelling  you really get to know and understand the characters and always get caught up in the lives  with a few exceptions  the script  by steve tesich  is good  in fact  tesich was a yugoslavian immigrant himself and based much of the script on his own experiences  all the acting is great  especially thelan and wasson  also reed birney throws in a strong  likable performance as louie  danilo s college roommate  and lois smith is very interesting in her role  and look quick for mercedes ruehl and glenne headly   basically  it s a real great story about immigrants  coming of age  love of america and covers the      s perfectly   this film was  unjustly  maligned on its release  the studio didn t know how to advertise it  it is a hard film to market  and the critics stomped on it  pauline kaels  review in  the new yorker  was particularly harsh   it barely played in theaters  i was lucky enough to catch it in      in its short theatrical run  and has simply disappeared  that s a shame  this is a movie that is just ripe for reissue  i m not betting on it  but you never know  a definite    all the way,1,
i watch many movies  but presently my genre number one is asian horror  i have just bought this dvd and i initially found  janghwa  hongryeon  an intriguing but confused film  since i had not understood many parts of the story  but i saw in imdb board a message titled  explanation of a masterpiece  all your questions answered  faster load   written by opiemar  and i was really impressed with the high quality of the explanations this user provided to viewers like me that missed points of the story  i would like to congratulate opiemar for his excellent work and suggest him to write a correct summary of this movie in imdb to help and guide other viewers   in the end  i agree that  janghwa  hongryeon  is a great korean film  but i do not give ten in my vote because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than once  like this film demands  and without the great support of opiemar  i would not be able to understand the story as a whole  i intend to see this movie again in a near future  my vote is eight   title  brazil    medo    fear,1,
i just can t get it  freaks out on the planet are talking about this one as a must seen  they even dare to call it a  s exploitation because the possessed girl is seducing priests and is masturbating all time  don t let me laugh  i watched the movie  seducing is only at the end of the movie and don t call it seducing it s just bad language that s she is talking  and the masturbationscene is a big laugh too  she tries to seduce her father while masturbating  let me be clear  with her clothes on you perverts out there  it isn t gory or bloody at all  everybody is vomiting on beyond the door  well  let me tell  that one is for me better than this flick  only the last   minutes the possessed one is vomiting and having weird eyes  if i had know that this is so bad then i would never caught me a copy  if you really wan t to see a  s exploiation about exorcism watch angel above  the devil below or other cheesy ones  a waist of time this is,0,
i first played this around     or     when i was with my friends i thought the game was really great and loved it   the game is simple on one player mode you go around as james bond and complete missions in different places like an arctic wasteland or a city my favorite was one with a tank on two player mode you and a friend choose from any character you wish and go all out with a fight through out the area you are in you will find ammo and weapons to help from hand guns to rifles to lasers and even your fists work   again with player two mode there are lots of places to go and some to unlock i find this game really fun but also very suspenseful because you never really know where your opponent is and it s surprising to see them behind a door where you are going   this game gets           stars or of       very good go play it sometime,1,
the movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency  putney swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black  and the agency needs a  token  on the board  swope is ignoring the meeting  reading jet magazine at the big table  and everybody is ignoring swope    suddenly  the ceo croaks on the spot  no time is wasted  a janitor is called to haul off the corpse  and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new ceo  and as the votes are tallied one by one  the tension is built up and then finally snapped in a hilariously ironic climax to the vote  that gives the viewer a delicious dish of logical implications to savor for the rest of the movie  if you ve ever talked back to some stupid television commercial  you ll like seeing this movie  too bad there don t seem to be any real putney swopes in the world,1,
i happen to have read all of junji ito s english released manga  i watched the tomie film and it was a big steaming pile of turd  thankfully uzumaki actually does justice to the manga  i think those who have read the manga will really appreciate this film more  as many screenshots and camera angles are exactly like in the manga and it is interesting to see how the book characters are played in the film  this film reminds me of eerie indiana  the ending differs to the manga  which i was expecting  kirie looks like her manga counterpart  and her male friend suits the whole very well  very creepy i have to admit  this film feels like a feverish nightmare  the kind you have when you were a kid  not really scary at all  but freaky  if you get my drift  another great horror from japan  get yourself a copy,1,
whoever plays the part of j  douglas williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job  he apparently received no credits  too bad   all the dead end kids do their jobs beautifully in this      entry  it is odd to watch them in a western setting with their brooklyn accents   i guess that should be bowery    they even show some swimming abilities   i think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing love crime story  my favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film  busby berkeley shows his dance movie expertise when john garfield shifts his feet and as we watch that move  the camera moves up to his face  i will not give away why or when  but the look on his face at that point probably brought the      audience to its feet in the theaters   some will think john garfield looks a lot like frank sinatra in many scenes  just his face  actually frank was not yet making movies so maybe frank looked like john  the boxer named smith in the movie looks like a clone of ed begley  jr   now i must tell you something that is not a spoiler  but if you watch the movie  watch grandma s hands  may robson does her part well  she seems to have hands that wander a bit  in a scene where she and a crowd go into the boxer s  john garfield  dressing room  watch where she touches the reclining john garfield while he is wearing only his trunks   a great ending  lots of wonderful characters   best line might be at the gas station      eight gallons  that s a dollar twenty eight     tom willett,1,
in the european tv industry  movies like this one are called  stickers   tv stations buy them and air them because when they wanted to buy broadcast rights to  let s say  titanic  some not really blockbusters were a part of the deal      hours is a story of a hospital  its employees and patients who have to face the worst flood slash storm ever  unfortunately almost from every scene or shot one can tell that is was a low budget film   newborn babies are very obviously not real  there is no background action and probably the worst thing is the doctor acting  the actors are not believable in their roles  their lines  when spoken  sound way too memorized  as if this was a read out camera test,0,
i saw it last night and i was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie  the whole audience was  bruce campbell has made a damn funny movie  i don t want to give anything away  but when the film turns and gets wacky  it gets really wacky  just one funny scene after another  my hats of to mr  campbell and crew for pulling this off on such a tiny budget  bruce was there to introduce the film and do a q and a  which was a treat  a lot of the questions people were asking were pretty lame  but bruce would turn it around on them and be all sarcastic  he was great  anyway  loved the film  i ll be looking forward to seeing this on dvd later this year  b sure to check it out on the sci fi channel this fall  i highly recommend this one,1,
very funny film with some of the best swedish actors  it s all filmed in black and white with the true    ish feeling  most of the film you are aboard a train headed for berlin in      among a mixture of characters from refugees to   gay guys and   nuns  i truly recommend this film if you like to laugh,1,
i went to see this movie not expecting much  but was pleasantly surprised by the teaming of robert de niro and eddie murphy  it was a fast paced movie and the hour and a half went by fast  this one certainly won t win any academy awards but it was a change of pace for mr  de niro  he is good in comedy  overall i enjoyed it,1,
this is a very mediocre jackie chan film and one of his absolute worst james glickenhaus ruined it   all the characters are decent i guess  but the story is so so  however jackie chan is still amazing in this even if he did look bored  jackie and danny aiello had zero chemistry together  and it was very boring a lot of times  however the finale was above average and managed to be fairly entertaining  and had some good stunts   i have not yet seen the hong kong version  however i m sure it s better then this dud  plus the twist is very predictable   it s really lifeless and bland  and i don t blame jackie for not looking happy in this  and if he didn t star in this it would have been unbearable and completely unwatchable  the opening is supposed to be memorable  but it s nothing i haven t seen before and done better at that  and i thought the whole film was rather lazy and could have been an awesome film if jackie had control of it   plus i really didn t root for any of the characters  this is a very mediocre jackie chan film  and one of his absolute worst james glickenhaus ruined it   not recommended even for die hard jackie chan fans  the direction is terrible   james glickenhaus does a terrible job here  with extremely bland camera work  bad angles  and keeping the film boring for the most part throughout  the acting is so so  jackie chan is amazing as always  however he is not his usual energetic self  and looks bored and ps ed off throughout the film  had zero chemistry with danny aiello  and i really don t blame him either   jackie rules        danny aiello is ok here  as jackie s partner  but his character is a bit of an ass  and he had zero chemistry with jackie  he did ok i guess  roy chiao is decent as the main villain  but was just going through the motions and wasn t all that menacing  he still is damn cool though  rest of the cast are average at best  overall not worth your time or money       out of,0,
these critics need to find a new job    this movie is based on a true story  which has made history  it illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all  the breathtaking chephallonia of greece has captured my heart and soul as if i too were there  the blue eyed cage   the delightful cruz were amazing  together they perfectly portrayed how a mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war  this movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it,1,
it s particularly hard for a director to capture film making without getting precious  inbred  over dramatic  or all three  breillat ably demonstrates the instinctive  lizard brain methods of a female auteur in extracting from two  cattle   as hitchcock called actors  a love scene of searing intimacy  her main battle is with her leading man   an actor is really a woman  she opines   although  naturally  it is the leading lady who will steal the show  i disagree that this is breillat s first comedy   romance  was at various points hilarious  but i accept that the french sense of humour can be elusive for foreigners  indeed  dozens of imdb reviewers detected no comedy in romance  by contrast  sex is comedy raises plenty of laughs  mainly by using an actor s prop that goes back thousands of years to plautus and the ancient greeks  we wondered  leaving the theatre  whether roxane s  beard  was a wig  a lovely performance from anne parillaud as breillat wrestling with her own script  looking ten years younger than her age,1,
rattlesnake  look out   is that a bra you re wearing or are you expecting an assassination attempt    spaz  what are you a homo or what     ok way to go you guys  feed fink  he s our hot man   do you know they use the most sophisticated training methods from the soviet union  east   west germany and the newest olympic power  trinidad tobago    oh spaz you old make out master    what  no mustard     oh my god his nose is bleeding    it s gonna get even bigger now   our political roundtable   henry kissinger will appear  yassir arafat is gonna come out  spend a weekend with the kids just rap with them    these and many other great lines make meatballs a hall of fame comedy  only in caddyshack is bill murray funnier  he probably ad libbed half the lines  the high school actors seemed to have a blast being in the same movie with him   hilarious movie to watch any time of year  not just the summer,1,
the hero john keem is going after some drug dealers who kidnaps girls for some reason  on his journey he uses karate and kung fu moves and i don t believe he got hit a single time during the movie  this is crap,0,
susie q is a great romantic prom movie  amy jo johnson  susie q  is a great actress  i think she did a great performance  i hope that sometime that the disney company could put this movie on dvd  i think it s kind of cool and a little bit hilarious  it s kind of sad when susie q dies in a car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob  but in the middle when no one suspects susie q it gets kind of funny and surprising  there is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much  but still i would recommend this movie to the whole family if they enjoy comedy  mystery  or romance type of movies  it s great  i think that amy jo johnson as susie q is cute,1,
i ve enjoyed this movie ever since i first saw it in the theatre  some movies have a cast of characters and a script that come together in perfect synergy  and this is one of them  the characters illustrate some truths about getting the best out of people  working together harmoniously  building a team and achieving goals  without ever preaching morality  the situations are crafted well and are consistent with the movie s opening premise  the tension builds nicely and the humor is clean and consistent throughout  the movie manages to pull me right in to root for the characters  and to laugh pretty well all the way through  this is a feel good movie as good as they come   what amazes me is that a movie which appears so simple can be so long term entertaining  the music is a perfect copy of music in the typical serious post war navy movies  which helps to create the humor and point out that greatness is in the eye of the beholder  the scenes in the credits are a great music video of  in the navy   which deserve their own full screen special feature  the scenes and cuts are crafted well  and the casting and acting is right on   this movie is a classic as great as any ever made  without any pretensions  in fact  the lack of pretension is what makes it so much fun to watch  i love these guys and gal   the other day i thought of the film  and wondered whether it was available on dvd  good fortune has come to us  and the dvd came out in may       i headed to the store  and snapped up a copy  then my wife and i enjoyed another hilarious night in front of the big screen  i ve rated this movie as a    because it comes together on all levels  far better than many high budget films and oscar winners  this is entertainment   listen up fox home video  you have a great movie in your vaults  and it s a shame to find a cheap shot dvd with badly degraded off tint colors only   years since release  so why not restore the colors and present the film as it was meant to be seen  i d gladly pay a few bucks more to get the picture right  i m grateful to have my own copy  now give us the eye candy that the film deserves  and how about recreating the credit sequence as a full screen music video special feature,1,
i am surprised by the relatively low rating this film has  it is a screwball comedy   romance film rolled together by someone besides billy wilder but it does a really good job   even won an oscar   it is ingrid bergman s first film in the us since the      s   even though she is no longer the young bombshell she was in her early films  she brings off a difficult role quite handsomely  this film proves she had multiple talents beyond her good looks   goldie hawn who won an oscar in this  her first film  as supporting actress is very good as the modern sophisticated yet quirky latest mistress to dentist playboy  love them   leave them walter mathaw  goldie is delightful to all the senses in this role which with a great cast set her up as a slam dunk for this early career award   this film is not real deep  but is a gem that has stood the test of time very well  not sure why it s average is so low as i give it a solid,1,
this is a movie that i watched when i was a young girl and never forgot  it is certainly not the best movie ever made  but there is something very special about it that i can t quite put my finger on  i love it  i am the kind of person who likes everything explained to me though and for that reason alone this movie drives me crazy    exactly what who is that mysterious witch lady and what is her relationship with tom  why and how did he become a water baby     why was he raised on the earth  it is questions like these that are just eating at me  i thought if i read the book i would get answers  but i just read an article that the book from which this story is  based  is a lot different  so i guess i ll never know what the writer was thinking    i still love this movie though and i recently watched it with my two year old niece  she loves it too although she insists on calling it  baby water  for reasons unknown to me  she loves the part where he jumps in the water and then declares  i m all clean    you have to understand that my niece is the cleanest   year old in the world   we watched that scene over and over    i am so glad that we can enjoy this film together  there should be more films like this   but what is up with the gay seahorse,1,
i loved this movie  it s a lot of laughs  the acting is good and the writing is really sharp  i d rather see a hundred movies like this than three lord of the rings repeating and repeating themselves   it s a low budget affair and seems to be shot on dv but looks good and jay mohr and julianne nicholson are great together  why do you have a ten line minimum  i m not a critic  just a patron   i doubt very much that quentin tarantino could write a picture this funny without filling it with masturbatory gratuitous violence  this movie should be seen on more screens than just one  i laughed from beginning to end,1,
i was just looking up   who will love my children  to buy  when i came across this web site and an entry made by a fellow briton   i am a great fan of this movie and would  and have  recommended it to all  what i found comforting is to find someone else who also finds comfort in the good will of others  i also have a son with aspergers  amongst other things  and it is also a fear of mine to think if anything ever happened to me and my husband  that someone would not only want to take on just my beautiful  normal  daughter  but my special and gifted son also  missing home and being able to relate to people raised with the same values as myself has more meaning than you know  living here in the us i have yet to meet anyone who has seen this movie  so to all of you reading this  if you have not seen it  make an effort to do so  it is a very moving experience  especially for anyone who is a parent  or even if you just have a sympathetic bone in your body  you will cry  and beg  after that you will count your blessings  and to anyone who has ever been through an experience like   or close to this one  my heart goes out to you  it makes me realize no matter how hard or stressful thing get  just remind yourself that there is always someone worse off than you  an amazing movie and what makes it more powerful is the fact that it is based on a true story  do not be put off by how sad it is  at the same time this movie is heart warming  and makes you feel encouraged about the strength and goodness of mankind,1,
i must admit  at first i was worried about farscape  the opening segment was not very strong  and i began to worry about what was to come  however  once it set in to familiar henson territory with the wry sense of humor  the unique and enduring characters  and the compelling story combined to create an excellent piece of science fiction  the story follows john crichton  played by ben browder  a scientist who has developed a spaceship and theory that rely on slingshot propulsion  however  during the first test  his craft encounters an unknown magnetic field  and he is propelled into an unknown galaxy  where he finds himself in the middle of a struggle between escaping prisoners  on the starship moya  and the peacekeepers  human enforcers   he is quite literally drawn into the prisoners ship  and after many twists and turns finds himself united with the prisoners  ka d argo  a luxom warrior  pa u zhaan  a delvian priestess  rygel xvi  a deposed ruler  and aeryn sun  a peacekeeper who has reluctantly joined the crew   with excellent special effects  moderate make up  and puppets and robots that exceed the henson standard of perfection  as well as a very well written story  and character driven plot  farscape looks to be a fantastically original  creative  and clever science fiction series,1,
i thought this was a very good movie  someone said it was  sick  so they couldn t watch it  i think if you realize its rated r then you will be prepared for the nudity and drug use  it is a good story and the acting is amazing  just can t be a prude to appreciate it  its basically about a mom who does drugs and wants to get clean so she calls a very wealthy old friend and he moves them to his estate and crazy things happen  i guess it is a drama  i am just so sick of people who don t like movies because of cursing or nudity  that is the world we live in  you obviously aren t comfortable with yourself if you can t see things like this movie  and it s rated r  so  that should tell you from the beginning that its not all peachy happy rainbows  i liked it  i think you will too,1,
those wishing to see film noir remakes  should not see this as as a remake  you will always be disappointed  instead  enjoy a gripping performance from dennis quaid and visual imagery to commend  the colour drains from the film  literally  not metaphorically    as the plot gathers pace  and the dialogue is crisp and gritty  the opening dialogue is clever  and the viewer is carried along by a sharp screenplay and a real  original film noir feel,1,
from the start you will like sam elliott s character  falon    a trustworthy cop that is notably loyal to his partner  but too loyal  and too revengeful when seeing his partner dead in an alley  cause he then kills who he thought to be the assailant before giving him a chance to explain  falon is an alcoholic  and that tends to sway him from being in self control  though he manages to direct his attention towards finding who s really behind his partners death  he carries along a rookie as his new partner  which seems to be seen too often in films  but esai morales does well in accompanying sam elliot  though puzzling pieces begin to fit to where morales begins a self approved investigation towards falon  he mainly wants to find the answers since fallon isn t letting him in on the whole story  and does not like what he finds  there is not a last minute showing at who the bad detectives are  which is okay  and they are not able to sway falon into joining them  leading to a dramatic ending  fine acting all the way around  with a touch of humor from paul sorvino who is the captain of detectives  it s a good movie that will make you want to see it several times  so it qualifies as a  must see   and a good addition to a movie collection   filmed in san francisco,1,
keys to the vip is one of the most entertaining  informative and hilarious shows that is on television right now  the idea is original  and well executed  as it manages to preserve the reality aspect  but still remain entertaining  all of the judges have a razor wit  they re not the nicest at all times  but if you re looking for comfort  go watch a chick flick  say what you like about validity of the show  but it is absolutely real  i know people who have competed on the show  and they have confirmed this    if you want to laugh  watch this show  it is on of the best comedy shows ever made,1,
well every scene so perfectly presented  never before had i seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every scene   well while i was watching this movie i remembered watching  amilie   amilie is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch  these movies are both based on a same plot line  but both of them are perfectly perfect in there own way and being able to create a world of their own   red is able to provoke lots of thoughts in people about destiny and dejavu s  and i am still thinking about it   the story is great and the ending is a bit funny  i was laughing in the end scene  well funny how this three movie red white and blue are connected   all in all a great work of art  a work of a masterman,1,
george   mildred   the movie lacks the talents of its tv writer john mortimer who brings the close quarter cut and thrust of george s class war with the fourmiles alive   the plot is cut from standard spin off cloth   hit man mistaken identity   and has as little tension as there are laughs  the producers should have taken a leaf from rising damp   also      which was also bought to the big screen after the tv series demise  and kept much of the story in familiar setting   yootha joyce died in      but she should not be remembered for this creaking piece of work encumbered as she was by her illness  mildred lacks the sharpness of her tv incarnation  cutting asides and withering looks largely directed at georges lack of libido  george s sputtering incredulity also gets lost in the more expansive sets  this is not to say that they were much to shout about  the budget for this movies looks pathetically small  a restaurant they go to is clearly a new semi starched house with some christmas lights adorning the front door   for fans of    s british comedy or those who just want to revisit an old tv companion from their youth this film can add nothing to the experience and they should just stick to the first four tv series out now on dvd,0,
if they had a zero out of    i would of entered it  everyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves taking money from the public  i don t know how films like this get released video or pay channel  i am disappointed in vincent gallo  val kilmer was in it for about   minutes  so i can t get that mad at him  only the person who listed him to be the star in it  it is like marlon brando in superman there is no plot except gallo searching and finding his friend in the catacombs  why they were searching for the gates of hell only the director knows  they should of kept this film in moscow and burned it for fire to keep all the homeless extras warm for the night  there is nothing more to say about this film that all the other reviewers have written  i wish i could forget this movie it hurts my brain,0,
an inspired choice of director for this latest brit flick  rose troche  who burst on the scene with the budget free tale of ny dykes   go fish  brings a gently jaundiced view to this tale of a londoner choosing the slightly inappropriate milieu of a male bonding society to declare his lust for a fellow seeker of masculine truths  the highlight for me is a scene where the society try to revert to being primitive hunter gatherers but end up ordering a take away  the film as a whole is wonderfully acted and troche  who d never be accepted by some of the lesbians she portrayed in her previous film  relishes the bigger budget by indulging in some wonderfully lingering pan shots that contrast with  go fish  s grainy hyperkinesis  a really enjoyable film,1,
what can i say   this movie has it all   romance  break ups  rich kids  punks and preps  this is my all time favorite movie that i can recite line for line    i remember when it first came out  i was    and couldn t get in    so finally got to see it on cable    i was hooked  wanted to move to california and be a valley girl    hey  i even remember the song by moon zappa  do you   tried in vain for years to get the never produced soundtrack   now you can find it on rhino records,1,
when i checked out the review for this film after i d watched it  i was surprised that there were people giving it good ratings   this is a film of bad camera work  everything  frightening  happens off screen  usually accompanied with a closeup of someone yelling  did you see hear that   well  no  we didn t see that  we can t  and when there weren t any close ups  the camera was doing something weird like rotating upside down  or shaking back and forth really  really quickly  to either convey action or to make us physically sick   the characters were unlikeable because every two minutes  they started screaming the same thing over and over again  i don t care if that s what it would  really  be like  i did not rent a scary movie to see reasonable things  i expect unreasonable things  like aliens  demons  or good acting  they were stupid  too  let s go have intimate relations in a cave  with all of our clothes on  speaking of which  the ending somewhat contradicts what domingo said immediately before he died  this bugged me a bit  though not nearly as much as the fact that the ending resulted in a    serious invasion of one girl s privacy   no plot  no climax  no good acting  terrible camera work  what s left  oh  right  the ending may have had a  twist  but generally with horror movies  the twist at the end actually has understandable relevance to what occurred during the film  sixth sense does  it explains a lot  hide and seek did  too  but the cavern had a lame twist that served as an  explanation   if you could call it that as it doesn t  explain  anything   don t see it  please,0,
most of the criticism of  attack of show  is from people who are unfairly comparing it to an old computer tv program called  the screen savers   people are upset because g  decided to cancel the  screen savers  and replace it with the pop culture based  attack of the show   to compare the two shows is like comparing apples to oranges    attack of the show  is a unique hour long program that covers current generation x y culture  it features segments on movies television  panel discussions  video games  new dvd releases  sex advice  new gadgets  mp  players  cell phones  etc   comic books graphic novels  magazines  and internet fads    it s a fun show  definitely worth checking out you are in your   s or   s  i give it an   out of,1,
okay  i m just going to disagree with the past comments that criticized this show  i happen to think this show is awesome   i mean when jasmin weber was still on and franzi was still alive  so addicting    and i was surprised to learn that this was categorized as a soap  because it just doesn t carry the same look and feel as soaps in america  soaps here are absolutely horrific  at least gzsz films on location  features real music and more plausible story lines  moreover  the acting on gzsz  for the most part  is quite believable especially with josephine schmidt and felix jascheroff   plus  soap actors are some of the hardest workers around in the business as they have the most demanding work schedules   if it s ratings are that high  it must be doing something right  soaps in america are shown in the day time and  historically  have always had rock bottom ratings  give gzsz a chance  trust me  it s good,1,
if you don t like italian horror  you won t like this film  on that note      overall    it was a terrible experience    many things happened  vanessa redgrave was scheduled to be in the film  and she pulled out  one of the actors was crushed by a car  i was engaged to be married  but by the end of the picture that was finished  my father died during the shooting    all kinds of things    dario argento on the making of  opera   i was truly impressed with argento and the film he made here   especially against such harrowing circumstances  the whole mystique of  macbeth  and its curse on those who attempt to stage the play adds untold volumes to  opera    throughout the film  argento imploys some of his most clever  and audience directed  tricks  a young opera singer  christina  is stalked by a violent psychopath who forces her to watch a series of brutal murders  by taping several sharp blades to christina s eyelids the killer makes it impossible for her to close her eyes   take a good look  if you try to close your eyes  you ll tear them apart  so you ll just have to watch everything    it is clear that argento put great care into constructing the faux  macbeth  opera on screen  and his hard work pays off  add to this several unforgettably brutal murders  an incredibly tense chase sequence  and the genius use of pov to portray a certain character  the role vanessa redgrave pulled out on  thank god  and you ve got one of the best italian horror films ever created   that said   it s still italian horror  why christina never seems to tell anyone about this brutal murders is beyond anyone s comprehension  some scenes might be difficult for certain viewers to stomach  but personally i felt more tension towards christina and her eyes than any of the brutal slayings in the film  the finale to  tenebrae  had my stomach churning more than anything in  opera   but that s probably just me   and the last five minutes    argento wanted it  he filmed it  and he s fought to keep it in the film  absolutely no one likes it  myself included  but it s not enough to ruin the rest of the film for me  it remains one of argento s best films to date,1,
i have always had this morbid curiosity when it comes to notoriously bad and unpopular movies  i also have always enjoyed so bad it s good flicks  you re looking at someone who actually liked recent cheese filled kid flicks like catwoman and thunderbirds          so i watched this  and it turned out that all the critics are right about this one  it s a major flop  but unlike a lot of flops  it isn t even enjoyable on any level  not even just to make fun of  it s just one boring cringe fest after another all the way through   i had been warned  i didn t listen  i am a fool   don t be a fool  don t waste time and money on this pile of trash,0,
when one watches romantic comedies  one knows what to expect  we ve seen enough of them over many  many years to know how they go  there s a formula  one which almost always begets movies that become popular with the genre s audience    not always in relation to their actual quality  how to play around with that  and create something more interesting  this movie has a suggestion    and it works relatively well  instead of simply following a lead  we follow him skillfully helping the unfortunate men  those who lack the attractive facade that would allow them to reveal the unseen good qualities that they possess to the women they are in love with  the plot follows smith as he works on his self proclaimed most difficult such case  kevin james  alongside his aid of james  we also follow mendes  who is fed up with men who lie to get what they want one particular scene that inspires great respect of smith s character is him meeting one such jerk  and putting him in his place   after seeing smith helping the disaster that is james  we see him with mendes    and in spite of his talent for helping others  he messes up    badly    with her  making a marvelous point about love  and how falling in love affects us  for a romantic comedy  this mostly avoids the pitfalls of such at times almost bordering on feeling like a spoof of the genre   though the last few scenes has the sweetness and the emotions of this type of films  whether or not they follow the formula will not be revealed in this review  the pace is quite good  it never really slows down  and seldom moves too fast  the acting is great  as far as pretty much everyone goes  the characters are nicely developed  and come off as real people  the humor doesn t always work    there are occasional gags that are less than fortunately executed  and one or two jokes that seem forced  however  for the most part  the film was funny  i recommend this to anyone who likes romantic comedies and anyone who is or have been in love  those who do not believe in love will have a difficult time with the last few scenes,1,
no this is not an ed wood movie   angora love  is stan laurel s and oliver hardy s last silent movie  the end of an era  in the     s laurel   hardy left a real mark on the silent movie genre with movies that are still popular and being watched and aired regularly  this present day   it s a shame that this movie is however not among their best   the premise of the movie sounds good and is good  the boys team up with a goat this time  which of course leads them into trouble and for us some hilarious situations to watch  it however at the same time is extremely silly and just totally unbelievable to watch the boys doing comedy stuff with a goat  most of the jokes in the movie still work good but the movie just however never gets truly hilarious or memorable  the comedy and story really feels lacking at times and is mostly too simple and predictable   of course still good and fun enough to watch for the fans but still a slightly disappointing last silent laurel   hardy entry,1,
if all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared  death in venice would have to be it  it is a monument in movie history  much criticized for being slow  boring and too obvious in stating it s point  an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed  first mentally  then physically   we should appreciate this movie for what it is   morte a venezia  was shot over    years ago  and it portrays a period even further back  at the beginning of the twentieth century   life was slow then  compared to now  people were supposed to behave in a certain way  hiding their true emotions even from themselves  director visconti and dirk bogarde  the leading actor  admirably succeed in showing how the aging composer von aschenbach discovers his romantic interest in a young boy  for a man like von aschenbach  in his time  this must have been a shock too powerful to come to terms with  we see his inner struggle  mostly on the face of bogarde  against the beautiful backdrop of venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music  composed by gustav mahler   this movie is slow  there is no denying it  no special effects  car chases or fights to keep the audience pinned to their seats  no perverted sex scenes either  the interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen glances from afar and the occasional smile   so  basically  nothing much happens in this movie  not if you want your senses to be hit like a base drum  if you want them to be played like the strings of a violin in a romantic concerto  this is the movie to do it,1,
leos carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that pola x is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever  seriously  if i could have figured out some way to climb inside my video monitor  i would have thrashed pierre to within an inch of his life  no one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid  both at the same time  except maybe heathcliff in emily bronte s wuthering heights  after spending     minutes with pierre  i need a large glass of brandy  never have i been so angry at a main character  ok  having said that  pola x is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes i ve ever seen in any film    which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking    and i m talking graphic here  by the way  pola x will beat the hell out of you  though  so make sure you re up for it if you decide to watch it,1,
if you re like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies  i guess it s kind of like slowing down at a car crash   you can t do better than this  the plot is inane  the special effects are hilarious and the acting is some of the worst you ll ever see    thumbs down  wooohoooooooo    seriously  i have no idea how the director and the  actors  can sleep at night  it s painful  and yet hysterically funny  to watch and i highly recommend it for those who want to punish themselves for something  if you can watch this crap without wincing  you re a better man than i ll ever be  i wonder if the producer of this garbage had any idea what he was getting himself  and his money  into,0,
this movie was pure genius  john waters is brilliant  it is hilarious and i am not sick of it even after seeing it about    times since i bought it a few months ago  the acting is great  although ricki lake could have been better  and johnny depp is magnificent  he is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor  and seeing most of johnny s movies  this is probably my favorite  i give it         rent it today,0,
i personally found the film to be great  i had it on pre order for a month and watched it twice the day i got it in the mail  and several time since   yes  the time lapses may be a bit much  but the rest of the movie clearly compensates for it  all amature cast  yet the acting was right on for each part  the plot itself is just    haggard  there s no other way to describe it  who makes a movie about someone getting f  gered     bam  thats who  genius  simply genius  two thumbs up  i would be honored to work with him any day  any time  on any thing,1,
but i can t say how i really feel about this pile of steaming dung  where to begin  the film quality  there isn t any  i ve seen clearer pictures on america s funniest home videos  the acting is substandard  the gore effects is okay  the clown mask is the best part of this movie  the story is repetitive  the same thing over and over again  at least in a friday the   th or halloween we stick with one main character for the most part  there is no main characters  just victims  man  now we come to the worst part of all  the final survivor kills the clown and finds out it was one of her friends  then when the police finally arrive  they don t believe her and she is locked up in a rubber room  what kind of ending do you call that  crap  that s what  in my opinion  there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie  that was just sloppy writing  the excuse   it has to ending badly  it s a horror movie   or  we need to end it badly to leave it open to a sequel  are just lame excuses and that is all  i must give the camp blood the thanksgiving turkey,0,
this film was sheer boredom from beginning to end  ok  so i salute boorman for raising the worldwide recognition of events in burma  but that is all he achieves  about    minutes into the film i thought  oh no  here we go again   and i could have told you exactly what was going to occur in the next    minutes or so  patricia arquette was out of her depth in such a role  and her acting was wooden and unconvincing  mind you  being saddled with such an awfully conventional script  maybe boredom set in  and was such reflected on the screen  a lot of the film was just plain laughable  at one stage  arquette s elderly companion is shot  and he is prostrate on the ground  in the next scene  he is sprinting through the forest  obviously attempting to break the world     meters record    or maybe he s just trying to run away from boorman    if you find it hard to sleep one night then play beyond rangoon on your vcr and you ll be snoring in no time  i very rarely critisize a film as heavily as this  but in this case it is completely justified,0,
i have never seen a b movie like this one    on the part that the nanny sofia is being killed    a hand of a woman appears on the tape handling the stick    how bad is that    lol  i seriously laughed and wanted to stop seeing the movie  but i kept watching it to see if this movie could get worse   lol   it is bad for itself    poor pinocchio   the only nice bit is the first time you see some special effects of pinocchio s face moving    apart from that the whole movie is awful    it s not really worth your time if you don t really have much to spare  but if you have nothing to do    go on    treat yourself with some  z  movie cos b movie is still too good for this one   lol,0,
we all know that the world is full of dodgy  rip off horror films  some of these can be fun to watch  due to their stupidity  awful effects and iffy dialogue  but raptor  which could have been in the same league as the equally pointless carnosaur series  does not even attempt to have any enjoyment in it  its so poorly done  it is really unbearable  even if your just watching it with the intentions of having a no brain day at home  where do we start  well    the sets are pretty drab  my old drama group created more realistic stages  the genetics labs look like they are from a university  and it looks equally unbelievable on the outside  even for cover up  why would you place yourself near civilisation where people can easily hear the dinosaur roars   whilst the doctors ward just doesn t look believable at all  next up in the complaints list is the creature effects  well  what can i say  absolutely pitiful  also  i think it s worth mentioning  the woman s tits should be mentioned as an effect  both of the main female characters have so obviously had boob jobs  and it brings the characters down  being one female is a respected member of police  whilst the other is the sweet   innocent  daughter of the towns sheriff  the acting  though  is by far the worst tragedy  eric roberts can be excused for at least trying a bit to give his role something  thats where it ends  corbin benson should have killed his costume designer for making his lacklustre performance look even more pathetic  whilst the female lead looks so bored  though  with this film you could let her off   the other character i ll point out is the daughter  who lets her tits do all the acting in the  raunchy  sex scene  ten minutes of endless re run shots of her bouncing on top of some bloke    all in all  and summed up as one  don t bother  just don t,0,
mediocre at best  slow  but probably more entertaining to the younger viewers  a young boy chris miller  is haunted by an indian spirit and horrid monster in the cellar of his father s new home  also in the cast are patrick kilpatrick  suzanne savoy and ford rainey,0,
am i right in thinking i went to see the same film as everyone else    this film was terrible  i m a fan of all   series of the league of gentelmen and have always respected the originality of the writers  even when the format changed in series    this film however was a blatant half effort  the plot was extremely poor having the characters going into the real world made this film see more like the last action hero  there was about   moments in the film that got a mild chuckle but the rest of the time i was wishing it would end  this would have been better as a    minute short on the dvd    it was more of an explanation of what they planned to do  and looked like some of the writers disagreed on the fate of the characters and they made a joke of this by killing him off in the first    minutes   if your a true fan of the league of gentlemens ability to stay fresh then you ll hate this film  if you only watch it cause there was nothing better on tv then u ll love it   someone back me up,0,
i didn t really know what to expect from  future kill   but i certainly hoped it would be a little better than what i got  i knew the rating was bad and the reviews were unfavorable  but the subversive dvd cover illustration looks beyond cool and i can t resist that  for a very long  too long  in fact  time  this film raised the impression of being an unofficial sequel to porky s with lame  vulgar and offensive fraternity pranks  five mega dorks  one of them resembling an exact young clone of jim carrey  desperately want to become members of a frat house but their ultimate initiation might just be a tad bit far fetched and dangerous  they are dropped in the city center with provocative marks painted on their faces  simultaneously with the outbreak of a violent gang war  it doesn t take too long before they are confronted with splatter  a seemingly half man and half machine warrior  who leads a gang of which i never really figured out who or what they were  were they a government experiment  cyborgs  terminator imitations from a distant future  does anyone care   future kill  is a bizarre amateur flick with a scenario that leaps from one subject onto the other without any form of logical connection or narrative  the plot borrows vital elements from great cinematic cult classics like  the warriors    escape from new york  and  the terminator   but the end result is one gigantic sci fi monstrosity  the costumes and special effects are quite pitiable and there s a truckload of cheap and gratuitous nudity  the acting is terrible  but i m willing to blame the retarded dialogs instead of the cast members  one to avoid at all costs  in spite of really cool dvd cover art  resist it,0,
i have seen most of john waters  films  with the exception of several of his very early ones which are not available  i have actually seen just about all of them  so it s obvious i am a big fan and it s certain that i have a high tolerance for the gross and irreverent in his films  while way over the top and disgusting  i adored female trouble and polyester  two monumental tributes to bad taste and excess that are seriously funny films  so i am certainly not squeamish and can take most of what waters has to offer  however  in pink flamingos he has created a film so repellent  so unfunny and so offensive that i couldn t even stand it  in his other films he made before he became more mainstream  they were funny  yet here  the humor just isn t there as it seems the intent is to shock the viewers and not entertain them in any way  i am glad that after making this film  waters  sense of humor improved  as divine consuming dog feces  as in this film  is shocking but not the least bit entertaining  my advice is to skip this film and just pretend it never happened and then watch his infinitely better films of the   s and   s,0,
this film was one that i have waited to see for some time  i was glad to find it has been everything anticipated  the writing of this film has been so finely crafted and researched far beyond what is seen by the audience  i found it amusing that so many people watching will not read between some very important lines but indeed if not the movie will make sense in a different way and is very brilliant  the film has many stories and characters woven together around this one character kilo   a man whom has rose from the streets amidst many woes and become a very powerful criminal  after spending some time in prison kilo finds a loophole in the justice system and through a disturbing turn of events is released only to find everything is not at all what it seems  kilo finds himself going up against the higher realm of society and political royalty in order to make clear how important a man s word is and stands for  a war begins as the street is in arms against lords of wealth and corrupt power   a build up to explosive and powerful non stop twists and turns  this film will leave you riveted  i found the cast of this movie to be outstanding and is not a movie to be ignored  excellent  go rent it today,1,
this movie will likely be too sentimental for many viewers  especially contemporary audiences  nevertheless i enjoyed this film thanks mostly to the down to earth charm of william holden  one of my favorite stars  and the dazzling beauty of jennifer jones  there are some truly heartwarming scenes between the pair and the talent of these two actors rescues what in lesser hands could ve been trite lines  the cinematography of hong kong from the period of filming is another highlight of this movie  all in all  a better than average romantic drama,1,
imaginary heroes is clearly the best film of the year  it was a complete and utter joy to watch  i was riveted  the whole audience up at the sunset five was riveted  when the film ended no one moved  spoke  nothing  i think this film is a perfect example of the of the power that drama has  especially in so much as it sets an example of the quality of drama  work of this younger generation    there were moments in your film  many  like at least seven  where i was struck by such a great amount of beauty  emotional beauty  that i actually couldn t breathe for a while  and for a catharsis junkie like me  that s about the best censorial experience i could ask for  it is the result of powerful  masterful storytelling and direction  like heavyweight stuff  like burtolucci and those guys    each element of the film fit tightly together  there were no missteps at all  the cast was amazing  i have been a huge fan of emile s and ryan s for a long time  and i thought they have never been better  i was am will be continuously stunned by this film  and i promise i will drag every person i know to see it  it should be seen  it should win awards,1,
i m not picky with movies  oh i ve seen so much crap i could watch anything  maybe that was the reason i watched this one to the end  im big fan of rpg games too  but this movie  its a disgrace to any self respecting rpger there is  the security camera footage of a game play would make it feel more realistic than this movie does  the lines  the cuts  the audio  everything is wrong  in some scenes you can see that it was filmed in some photo when       spoilers ahead      people running around does not disturb people sitting near computers  i mean would you continue your work if you got ninjas around you  oh and the jokes about pirates  that s the worst one yet in movies      spoilers end       at least first one felt like a documentary  now it looks like someones home video experiment  you can find better movies at youtube  top line  don t waste your time and money on this one  its as bad as it comes,0,
there s an underlying current in all the positive reviews of this movie   it s just a brainless comedy  don t take it seriously  chillax dude    well that s one point of view  the other would be   why are we accepting exactly the same script  the same formula and the same unfunny people in all these  comedies    what you get is a slacker who  through some totally unreal circumstances  has to change his life  always a he   overcome a set of circumstances which would only pose a problem to a raccoon or a teenager  beat the equally stupid bad guy who is trying to steal the gal he met two days earlier and triumph by remaining a slacker but with more money self esteem  on the way somebody does something gross but very illogical  this means you the viewer can call someone after the movie and say something like  you won t believe it maaann  this guy finds the otter drowned in the bucket of diarrhoea the other guy left after he ate laxative brownies  then he shines his shoes with it   hilarious   most of the usual names turn up  david spade and rob schneider do unfunny shtick but they re crrrazzeee characters   a russian and  i m holding my sides  a waiter in a vegan restaurant  adam sandler  the king of the brainless unfunny  illogical comedy co produces and some talentless nobody called dante shows up  yet again  the us will have to explain to the rest of the world what this guy dante is famous for cos we are clueless  allen covert plays a    year old which got the biggest laugh of the night from me  he was    and looked years older   did i laugh  yes  but no more than i would at a tv sit com and i don t have to pay a penny to watch them  please stop making these movies,0,
it has started quietly  if your are looking for an action packed movie this is absolutely not the right choice  all characters are slowly depicted on the scene  stroke after stroke on the scene canvas  none can take away his hands to the priest and so the sisters lifespan devotion can only remain into the village  philippa and martina know their destiny  belong only to the village  so when you understand that  you are on the movie scene  in the village that becomes the whole known world in that time  when  no technology can let you imagine anything else than the campaign  the village  the sea  you feel the rhythm of that ancient village s life  watching the movie in a cold snowy late afternoon can cause you to approach this evening dinner with some sumptuous expectations      the final sentence that give a title to babette s sacrifice far from paris  an artist is never poor   superb photography  many situations depict portraits and landscapes as they were styled on canvas there  in jutland  in   th century,1,
i m not from usa i m from central europe and i think the show is amazingly good  it can be easily compared with married with  children  my title says that it isn t show for conservative public  i mean i m not so liberal but it may be slight difference between european conservatism and us cons  anyway  show is starting to be very popular in our area and it s very bad that it contains only two seasons  last episode opens many continuous and funny moments  anyway i and many peoples would be glad if that would continue playing  the last thing i m thrilled about this is some moral education very nice packed into humorous scenes  i mean i have seen many comedies that has over two and even more minutes of very sad in tragic scenes that absolutely don t fit into comedy  war doesn t contain something like that and is made for laughing  it s like the simpsons and married whose also don t have any sad or even unfunny moments  i m apologizing for my awful knowledge of english but i still hope that you will understand what i meant,1,
i have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind  the trauma  the suspense is just amazing  i ended so wound up in the psychological fear and philosophy of it  and relating it to reality  movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don t forget  those that make you doubt your reality  a problem could be the quality  but that doesn t bring down the essence of the movie   the idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer  i just totally loved it  so many clues and twitches and puzzles  one of the best movies ever  hands down,1,
i was suckered in by the big names  rob lowe  mario van peebles  burt reynolds  and the fact that it was an independent film  unbelievably slow beginning     minutes  two dreary songs and a botched rip off  i didn t care about the characters  and the plot never tempted me to even pretend it could be realistic  i can t believe this is what makes it to the screen  i loved watching this film because it felt so good when it was over,0,
latter days is the best gay movie of the homosexual genre  most of the films entail sappy stories  one night stands  and let us not forget infamous baseball teams  latter days actually contains male affection beyond the kiss in the dark  and quite graphic material that made me wonder whether the film belonged at blockbuster or badpuppy com  the films emotional journey is what sets it above the rest in the genre  not until this film had i seen a story of such intense passion and love  and the torture that it can bring  i think when people cry during movies they should be beaten  but i found myself sobbing throughout several scenes because of the realistic nature of the world in which we live  i suggest every gay male see this film  and if you have a boyfriend  thank him,1,
i can t believe this movie only scores      this surely ranks up with the best of hitchcock s movies such as vertigo or marnie  the only reason i can think of why the score is so low  is that for the most part  the man    renounces violence and certainly won t get a diploma in  sex and crime    what it derives its tension from is not violence  it s the reckless energy of these criminals that take a child from his parents and are ready to kill the kid if the operation fails  today  having seen a lot of hardboiled kidnapping movies as mel gibson s ransom  this seems normal  but in the     s  where family was all in contemporary america  the thought of such a crime surely has stirred up emotions a lot   and this tension still works for me  today  yeah  these guys are selfish  ignorant bastards  disturbing in how they act  it s a deal for them  and they want to be  good businessmen   disregarding the fact that business here is kidnapping kids and assassinating politicians in the opera     what makes the movie great  however  are the creative aspects  the kinky ideas of hitchcock  the outrageously disturbing scene in the church  which brings it to the viewer s attention how alone  how abandoned the protagonists are  nobody caring  nobody helping  the people in the church just going home      the meeting with the owner of that shop stuffing and preparing dead animals  which stresses the somewhat  oriental  flair the movie has from the opening scenes abroad   last not least the role of music in this movie   music is the key principle here  as    spoiler    the assassination of the targeted politician is to be done exactly in the moment of a loud orchastra tutti gong  so hitchcock lets the camera follow the orchestra score and you now it will happen in a second    bang    and then  of course  doris day singing que sera  which became more famous than the movie itself  she sings it to notify the kid of his parents being in the embassy     all in all  a classic,1,
darr        was an incredible movie  in my opinion  it is one of bollywood s finest  the movie itself triggers feelings of sympathy  fear  confusion  happiness  and sadness  shahrukh s role was unbelievable  in fact he gave obsession a new face  juhi chawla s innocent and girlie character contrasted greatly with shahrukh s fiery and passionate character  sunny deol s role made the  good guy  role seem like the  bad guy  one  the fact that shahrukh  not sunny  captivated the audience s attention proves that everyone has that helpless inner drive to pursue something that s not really in their hands  even though the movie is several years old  it surpasses any recent one  the song  tu mere samne  was full of passion and meaning  his personality fit the role perfectly  he should seriously consider re starring in a similar film,1,
jack brooks  quirks are  at first  somewhat charming and lend to the deliberately campy feel of the beginning of this movie   i found myself getting angrier and angrier as i was duped into seeing this one through to the end  in hopes that the payoff would be worth the super tedious wait   the climax can t begin to make up for all the setup time   normally one might expect shallow characters from this genre  but the fact that the wait time before action index is so high  should mean that the meantime would be devoted to some interesting character development   not so   while not without its initial charms  this movie ultimately infuriates  and disappoints   wish i could get all that setup time back  to reinvest it into something that pays off,0,
this is one of the best films i have ever seen  how anyone can knock this movie just befuddles my imagination  first of all  gooding s and harris s performances were simply spectacular  especially gooding  that is the only way i can describe the acting  spectacular  you have to imagine how difficult it would be to play a character like that and pull it off  then you see gooding  and his performance was magical  as for the plot  since it was based on a true person  it goes where the lives of the characters go  for all the action buffs  it might be a little slow  but then it s not an action film  i definitely give this movie a     it deserves nothing less,1,
i must have been around ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to see this martial arts movie at the   drive in   at the circle drive in in long beach  the title was   hammer of god   from which i can never forget for some reason  but what i do remember are the different scenes that have left an imprint on my mind forever   my brother always reminds me of the movie although it has been forever it seems since we seen the movie  from time to time throwout the years i would look for it at the rental stores and from time to time i would check on the web and for some reason it appears like it is never available or no one knows what movie i m talking about   if i only knew if and were it was available i would love to purchase that movie  if anyone is aware of its availability please inform me,1,
i put this second version of  the man who knew too much  to my top    hitchcock movies  together with  frenzy   it s probably the most argued film among the fans of hitchcock  i consider it far better than  say   rebecca   which has gained unreasonably much appreciation   the film contains many ingenious scenes  most of them have been mentioned in other reviews   but that s something to be expected from hitchcock  it takes almost half an hour until things really start to happen  but that time is used for preparing the following happenings  which are full of intriguing suspense   if you can ignore the clumsy rear projections  the only weakness of this film is the main villain  played by bernard miles  who is a rather flat and undeveloped character  luckily  there is a creepy assassin in the form of reggie nalder  and hank  the little boy  isn t as irritating as most kids in old movies,1,
i really love this movie  it has a very real feel to it  i believe it was never popular because of the subject matter  however  because of the subject matter  it makes the movie all that much more important   this is an  a  movie and i recommend it highly  if you liked        book or movie  i think you will like this one as well   this is harsh  to say the least  including mental and physical acts of torture  some pretty vile  not for the week at heart or stomach  no gore  but his movie is so great at projecting the mental anticipation it doesn t need blood and guts   if you are not a realist or a pestimistic person i don t think you will enjoy it  it leaves you with an uneasy feeling about humans  what they re capable of  and the very real possibility that our government s does not necessarily have our personal best interest in it s heart,1,
john travolta was excellent as  michael  in the movie by the same name  i don t think a better portrayal could have been done  the movie was funny  yet touching  michael is a very  human angel   if their is such   andie macdowell is superb in her role as a reporter  as she goes from disbelief to belief  bill hurt and robert pastorelli are great as fellow reporters  each bent on proving the hoax of the angel on earth  each of the supporting cast is wonderful  especially the older woman  i do not know her screen name   who plays michael s mother  one of the cutest movies i have seen in years    i could watch this movie dozens of times,1,
unfortunately  koontz seems doomed to die without seeing a decent adaptation of his work  whispers follows the original book very closely  seemingly until the production company ran out of money  all of the sets in the first half of the movie were meticulously recreated from the book   something which has been lacking in many other koontz films  despite its other  numerous  downfalls  i continued to watch in anticipation of some really great scenery  wrong  by the time the detectives show up at the crack head s apartment  in the book   the movie is out of funds  and one of the most suspenseful scenes from the book  is ruined  where the book offered grisly discovery  a search and a chase through the guys apartment  the movie offers the backseat of the guys car   let s face it   koontz writes without a budget in mind  because imagination is free  if a koontz novel ever gets made into a decent movie  no one will go and see it  because they have been let down so many  many  many times before  this is why dean koontz s frankenstein is now just frankenstien   if you had seen your work butchered that many times  you d get out early if it looked like happening again,0,
playmania is extremely boring  this is the basis of the show  mel or shandi ask extremely easy questions that a   year old could answer at an extremely slow pace  this show lasts for   hours and they probably only play about    games in that period  people may like this show because the hosts are eye candy  but they re hotness completely is destroyed by the fact that they are so friggin annoying   during the show they mention that we need more players a million times  the top   surveys that they do probably takes about    minutes out of the show  this show is probably one of the worst game shows ever made  one of the reasons they probably don t have callers is because the show is so cheap with the money  the most money i ve ever seen them hand out was       i wouldn t be surprised if this  game show  is canceled by the end of,0,
stay far away from this film  the fact that you re reading reviews tells me you may have already been tainted by the awfulness it carrys  this is a truely horrid movie    so let s get down to the problems  writing and direction  it wouldnt surprise me if these were handled by a group of overactive gradeschoolers that watched  scream  and  i know what you did last summer  a few too many times  giant gaping plot holes abound  while i can t congratulate them for this movie  its nice knowing they re finally potty trained  actors or lack thereof   only the finest for this film    the finest extras ever to grace a screen  now starring in their speaking role debut  as a disclaimer  i have to note that i am capable of watching and enjoying just about anything  i recognize a good movie when i see it  but i can still giggle and smirk during bubble boy  yes folks  its true   so when i say to avoid something  you know i m not kidding,0,
years after this was made  castro still reigns  unfortunately  we re left scratching our heads wondering how the dim witted maniac played by scenery chewing jack palance made it as far as       i stumbled back across this recently  and was amused at noticing the incomparable sid haig and  b  movie favorite paul  untouchables  picerni among the rebels  fleischer was obviously well past his prime when he directed this foolishness  some of the lines are classic in a  did he really say that kind of way   the other thing i just noticed is that the score and the sound  not the dialog  are actually excellent    the only first rate elements of the entire production  so  don t watch this to learn anything about history or acting  but if you feel like watching this as a goof  bring the beers and have some fun,0,
it does not surprise me that this short     minutes  b w movie that was made    years ago in the soviet union during the short period called  ottepel   or  the thaw   has gained so much love and admiration among the movie lovers over the world  it is sublime and beautifully filmed  some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time  sergei urusevsky s camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated  the film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman  it is also the film about loyalty  memories  ability to live on when it seems there is nothing to live for  it is about forgiveness  and about hope  the film received  absolutely deservingly  the grand prix at cannes film festival and tatiana samoilova was chosen as a recipient of a special award at cannes for playing veronika  the young girl happily in love with the best man in the world in the beginning of the movie  after separation with her beloved who went to the front  the loss of her family in the bomb ride  and the marriage to the man she never loved and only wished he never existed  she turned to the shadow of herself  she became dead inside  her long journey to redemption  to finally accepting death of her beloved and to learning how to live with it  is a fascinating and heartbreaking one and it simply won t leave any viewer indifferent   for me  the movie is very personal and dear because i was born and grew up in the city where its characters lived and were so happy in the beginning  i walked the same streets  squares  and bridges over the moskva river  every family in the former soviet union had lost at least one but often more than one family member to a combat or to the concentration camp or to the ghetto or to hunger  cold  and illnesses during wwii and my family is not exception  my mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never healing pain of losses not just from the movies and the books   cranes are flying  speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me very deeply  it is a masterpiece of movie making but it is a part of my life   my background  my memory  and my past,1,
the stark  cold landscape of big sky country  with its majestic snow capped mountains juxtaposed to barren plains  is put to poetic use here in this lynchian fable slide picture show about death and melancholy from the young and talented polish brothers  who previously treated indie movie fans to the bizarre and fascinating  twin falls idaho   a film about a young woman falling in love with two brothers who happen to be siamese twins   a little orphan boy is dying  and a town is about to flooded in the name of progress  in the form a damn and hydroelectric power plant   with its eerily pleasing music score  minimalist dialogue and character development  and uncanny fantasy sequences involving some very unique angels  the polish brothers put their focus on what every good film artist knows a film should be about  the moving pictures   the images  the scenes   paintings of deep beauty captured on celluloid  this is best to be viewed late at night so that the haunting imagery can linger in your mind and wash over you as you drift off into sleep  the fact that all of this was done on a shoe string budget of less than two million dollars puts hollywood with their bloated film costs and hollow movies to shame and indicates something grand to come from the polish brothers in the future,1,
first of all  i d like to say that i really enjoyed this movie  however  that said  i can t say that it was a  good  movie  i went into the theatre with pretty low expectations  something i ve learned to do   i m glad i did  because the plot and development wasn t stellar  the jokes were low grade humor  but  i was in the right mindset to enjoy them   i wasn t the only one  in fact  the entire theatre was laughing out loud  i didn t hear anyone complain after the movie came to a close  i even saw one guy fall out of his chair laughing  but again  i have to warn you  grandma s boy is not a top quality film  it is a funny  albeit low brow  movie  and if you go with the right mindset  you ll really enjoy it  oh  and don t take kids to it,0,
this was the most god awful movie i have had to sit through     minutes into the film and i couldn t take any more  seriously  do not bother with this one unless you are a sentimental nut job or one of those pseudo arty types that like this kind of tripe so that they may feel more cultured  boring  although the acting is fine  the kid is just plain irritating  some scenes are a little strange with very weird close ups  i don t know why they did the whole movie in black and white  but whatever effect they were hoping to have failed miserably  there was just nothing to watch  and although its a sad tale  supposedly  its just so stupid that its hard to feel any sympathy for the characters,0,
hello it is i derrick cannon and i welcome you to the first ever cannonite review show  my movie for this week was debatable  what route what movie  what excellent four star epic would i choose  guess what i decided to pull a one eighty and go the other route  i ve decided to review a movie so atrocious that it totally killed what could have been a very unique concept  the movie i will review today is jack frost two revenge of the mutant killer snowman  the stars in this movie include christopher allport as sam tiller  eileen seeley as anne tiller  marsha clark as marla david allen brooks as agent manners  sean patrick murphy as captain fun  ray cooney as the colonel and scott macdonald as the killer snowman himself jack frost   it s hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny jack frost loved the carrot scene  but it s even harder to believe that this is the exact same cast  the movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and captain fun was introduced  what was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie the only possible reason i could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was total killer snowman fodder  sam tiler seemed more paranoid then he did in the original  his babbling about anti freeze was one of the most pathetic display i had seen in a movie  his wife however was one of the few bright spots  she played her role as the main woman to a hilt  she was a voice of reason in film of pure idiocy  the scene where she figures out how to kill the snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie  ray macdonald once again did a great job as jack frost despite what he was given  if it wasn t for such weak characters he could have been immortalized like chucky freddy and jason  laugh if you must but when it comes down to it jack frost had spunk  he had humor  and most importantly he had an undoubtable vicious streak   this movie could have been so much more  it could have been a continuation of a great franchise  instead any plans to make a jack frost three have been canceled   this movie gets a two out of ten for me  and it s lucky that it even gets a one,0,
red sonja is flawed  weak and lacking  even the camp ness isn t good   there are only two good things about  red sonja   the costumes  even though the red sonja costume is ridiculous  it s ironic that a girl who is even afraid to be touched by men  because she was raped  still choose to wear so few little clothes  even when it rains   and the music by ennio morricone  still the movie is somewhat watchable but certainly not recommendable   the story is extremely simple and they didn t even bother to make it interesting  the story could have been forgotten if there had been some good action sequences and some humor  both are present but are seriously flawed in many ways  the movie takes itself too serious and tries to impress but fails completely   brigitte nielsen is an horrible leading lady  i don t know who s accent is worse  hers or arnie s and on top of that  she can t act  there is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters which makes the love story totally unbelievable  even worse was sandahl bergman as the main villain who acts more poorly than a paper bag  ronald lacey was somewhat good in his role  but my god he looked horrible  he changed so much since his  only well known  role in  raiders of the lost ark   maybe it had something to do with his illness which claimed his life in       and by the way  what was with all those  raiders of the lost ark  actors in this movie  next to ronald lacey  pat roach  terry richards and tutte lemkow appeared in a role  it seemed like some kind of  raiders of the lost ark  reunion   the only times when the movie gets a bit interesting is during the  sword fights even though some of them are needless and weak   only really watchable for the fans of the fantasy genre,0,
hadnt heard a lot about this movie  except it being national award and oscar entry  its a marathi movie  n i cant make out apple from orange in marathi  but when i saw the movie playing on dd  late sunday night  i just got glued  now i am no judge of cinematic techniques and acting skills  but i have watched a good number of movies  of various genres  and for an average viewer  i will highly recommend this movie  the feel is very earthy and realistic  though there are some melodramatic moments  watch it to feel human  lately haven t seen any movie  which touches heart  especially in hindi cinema  the crowning achievement of the movie is when the young kid returns home  the camera moves around to reveal the kid  wearing black glasses  having lost his eyes  the kid hears the other kids splashing in the water and starts clapping  i was awestruck  and the two hours i spent watching the movie   very much worth it,1,
i saw this movie by accident while in paris  i went into the wrong theater by accident and by the time i realized it wasn t a preview or a short film  i was hooked    paulina does a phenomenal job of holding your attention with her acting  i can t say enough how impressed i was with her portrayal of this real femme fatal  the rest of the cast performs very well too  don t get me wrong  this is not the greatest film ever made but given i knew nothing about it i was left with a lasting and very positive impression   finally  not speaking french in france paid off for once  i didn t stop talking about this film for   weeks after seeing it,1,
this is easily one of the worst films i ve seen in many years  i started viewing the film not expecting much and that is exactly what it delivered    not much  in fact  it ended up delivering even less than i expected  my first reaction when i saw the opening portions of the film was that i would probably end up rating it a      i thought that it seemed to have reasonably good photography and a haunting atmosphere   as the film progressed however  the rating kept going down and down in my mind mainly due to pedestrian acting and a plot that went from being just plain silly and tasteless at the beginning to being both silly and repugnant near the end  by the time the movie was over  i was willing to rate it no more than a        don t waste your time or money on this one,0,
i give this nonsense a   instead of a   because there is a worse show called haunted homes  but this kid and his buddies conduct their investigations like total idiots  they assume that there are ghosts from the get go and if they ever find rational explanations behind the experiences they have to be drug kicking and screaming into admitting it  but beyond that  the show s whole format is incredibly annoying  even though a lot of it seems scripted  the college educated kids who make up the the cast can barely speak english but still insist on trying to use  big  words they obviously don t understand  and head investigator ryan s ridiculously self important voiceovers make me just want to throw the tv through the window   and he looks stoned all the time   in short  this group make the guys from taps on ghost hunters look like mit scientists,0,
considered by many to be a strangely overlooked chabrol it seems to me the reason it has been cold shouldered is its sleaze factor  not as overtly sexy  violent or gory as many films of this period it nevertheless starts rather startlingly and although becoming more measured continues to ooze a rather unpleasant odour  ms audran  not here the ice maiden but a drunken mother  donald pleasence does a cameo as a child molester  david hemmings has his eyes on underage sex and the central theme involves the relationship between a brother  sister and niece  no not very nice at all and chabrol treats it all as if it is very normal  like it might be in some small french village   instead of ed mcbain s new york city  had this been treated in a more sensational manner then it would have been a more acceptable but lesser film  here we really have to choose between the likelihood of various unpleasant options before the final denouement  very watchable,1,
this is one of my favourite westerns  what a cast  glenn ford plays his role in his usual mild  controlled but firm manner  ford plays one of the smaller ranchers in the shadow of the mighty anchor ranch that wants to swallow up the whole territory  edward g robinson plays the crippled patriarch of the anchor ranch and barbera stanwyck plays his sly scheming wife  there is plenty of action in this western that is quite impressive  the scenery is delicious and the letterbox scope photography is breath taking and the soundtrack is stereo  i would say that this western had a size able budget it looks expensive  one of a series of great glenn ford westerns,1,
this movie is awful beyond belief  it s a low budget  badly written  piece of pointless garbage  but the saturday afternoon i stumbled across it on tv still sticks in my mind as one of the most entertaining i ve ever spent in front of the television  the badness of this movie is epic    maybe not ed wood epic  but close  the premise is hysterical  men are banned for being too dangerous and imprisoned in    haw     football stadiums   the pseudo dyke culture is laughably bizarre  there s an underground sex trade with women who dress up like men to service  deviants   and the  last man  of the title is a pitiful reincarnation of rocky from rocky horror picture show  i didn t get to see the end of it  which i have to assume was so dripping with syrupy  what have we all learned from this   nonsense it would bring on an urge to brush the teeth  but everything in the first two thirds was so memorably bad  even if the last third turned out to be a pale imitation of the rest  it s still worthwhile for anyone who gets a kick out of campy  stupid  brainless sci fi b flicks,0,
the film made no sense to me whatsoever  good actors sergiocastellittoaparticular favourite  he was great in  uomo dellestelle   thestarmaker but that was made by giuseppe tornatore  a great italian director as opposed to the mediocre one who made this effort  but awful  rambling script  terrible editing and a director who seemed to have no idea of what he was trying to say  and ended up saying exactly nothing  apretentious load of rubbish  but the sort of film that certain italianpseudo intellectuals whom it was my misfortune to have known in the dim and distant past would have loved it  and unfortunately italy has no monopoly on these  they can be found everywhere and probably acclaim this as a great masterpiece  i never thought much of bellochio as director  i remember seeing his first film  pugninella tasca   fists in the pocket   or some such title  in rome when it was first shown close on    years ago  i was living thereat the time   all the usual pseudos raved about it  but it left me pretty cold  i didn t think he was much of a director then  and still don t  age has certainly not improved him  and this film must rank as one of his worst,0,
monday  october          so i got together with my dad as i always do  we ordered some japanese take out  turned off the lights and pushed play  i m an avid fan of horror movies  however  the cavern released on dvd this october was most certainly a let down  it seemed promising  meeting all the standard requirements of any horror movie machine  drawn out beginning with antagonistic character present  a cannot be omitted sex scene  and the all too familiar pre spook  when they spook you unexpectedly but it turns out to be the idiot buddy   then finally when it got down to the nitty gritty  i was ready for some real gore action  the director  i admit was keen  of course you would have to be to fill in an entire    minutes with people running back and forth in a space about   ft wide  it all begins when some college bound  cavers  get together for yet another cave dive  they all seem like seasoned pros  very serious and spiritual about the whole cave experience  this time they bring a new by along  some annoying photographer too blinded by his national geographic cover to understand the full dangers of cave diving  as they descend deep into what they call  hell pit  they soon realize that they are not alone in the chasm of death  i will politely leave out any spoilers if you are naive enough to not heed my advice and avoid wasting your time  although the atmosphere and background music was spooky  and there was sure a lot of blood and gore  when the moments approached to witness some actual dismemberment it was more like watching porn without the full frontal  the camera work was purposefully dark and sketchy  i guess the director used it for effect  i suppose the thing i like most about the movie were the moving characters  they deserved acadamy awards for those touching bickering scenes  i almost shed a tear when they finally  got it     a tear for joy  if you like dry horror  soft porn  and you hated braveheart  then this is the right movie for your next saturday night,0,
i took a group of young people who were the same age as the protagonists and it appealed to us all  i agree with the other post  the wilson guy worked a thankless script into a great minor character  it is good to have a movie for a certain age demographic  too old for pg  too young for r   it also shows how they think and maneuver in junior high school  you had to love how well jimmy buffet did as the cool teacher  he kept us adults awake  the level of kids questioning authority was kept reasonable  their motives were specific and not like some a d d  rebel  the setting and music were beautiful  overall  if you enjoyed holes  this is really similar,1,
i think i would rather have my piles clipped with a pair of rusty clippers than bear another   minutes of this movie  in fact i cannot even be bothered to go in to detail  not sure how they managed to get the needles into the wooden actors to cure them  better off for all concerned if they had just nuked the island after finding out about the virus  that way it would have lasted as long as the commercial break  and we could have moved on with our lives  plus one more thing was this rubbish commissioned by the god channel  as all they seemed to do was praise the bleeding lord most of the time  avoid like the plague  in fact i would prefer it,0,
leos carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that pola x is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever  seriously  if i could have figured out some way to climb inside my video monitor  i would have thrashed pierre to within an inch of his life  no one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid  both at the same time  except maybe heathcliff in emily bronte s wuthering heights  after spending     minutes with pierre  i need a large glass of brandy  never have i been so angry at a main character  ok  having said that  pola x is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes i ve ever seen in any film    which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking    and i m talking graphic here  by the way  pola x will beat the hell out of you  though  so make sure you re up for it if you decide to watch it,1,
this is a  revised  riverdance presentation  staged at radio city music hall in new york city  of the three irish  dance  musicals that i watched during the mid to late    s  which includes the first  riverdance  and  lord of the dance   i liked this one the best   i thought it was better than the original  held in dublin  ireland  because it adds segments that are mostly good  it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn t good to begin with  this is just a very solid show with few weak spots  to be certain  there are some songs dances that are just  fair  but none that are poor  which is amazing considering there are    numbers in all   the cast is similar to the first riverdance with the main exception of colin dunne replacing michael flatley as the featured dancer  both are extremely talented  the major difference might be in their looks with dunne a little  goateed black haired guy while flatley is the clean shaven blond  i prefer dunne because flatley s ego is so big he gets annoying at times  the female lead  jean butler  thankfully  is still there and is great to watch  what graceful beauty and talent  butler and the rest of these women have the greatest legs i ve seen on dancers  i also enjoyed the dancing of maria pages  a spanish flamenco performer  and two guys  daniel b  wooten and ivan thomas  one number   with those two pairing off against dunne and two other dancers    is called  trading taps  and is terrific fun to watch  maybe the highlight of the whole show  i have no complaints about violinist eileen ivers  either   the  fast  irish songs here appealed to me the most  i appreciated the audience not getting in the way of the performance either with shrieks and screams like the women do in the  lord of the dance  video,1,
the chilling directed by deland nuse and jack a sunseri is one of the worst zombie flicks i have ever seen why linda blair  the exorcist   witchery  appeared in this stinker is beyond me the plot is really dumb the frozen bodies at a cryogenic lab are revived after lightening strikes and turned into cannibalistic zombies the characters are completely one dimensional and stupid the zombies look horrible and there is no gore avoid this cheap piece of trash like the plague my rating   out of,0,
the film disappointed me for many reasons  first of all the depiction of a future which seemed at first realistic to me was well built but did only feature a marginal role  then  the story itself was a weak copy of lost in translation  the middle eastern setting  man with family meets new girl overseas  karaoke bar  the camera movements and the imagery   all that was a very bad imitation of the excellent lost in translation which had also credibility  this movie tries to be something brilliant and cultural  it is not  i wonder why tim robbins even considered doing this film   the female main actress is awful   did she play the precog in minority report  and why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this  lost in translation didn t have to show excessive love scenes  r rated just for this  this movie isn t even worth watching it from a videostore,0,
i struggle to see the point of this movie  it is supposed to be a comedy but i didn t laugh once  the storyline is one that could have been interesting in a well made movie  but since this is acted by comics  the result is totally unbelievable  as comedies should be   the comic strip series was very hit and miss  even withing the episodes  and it is fair to say all of the people involved have gone on to do greater things  one to avoid  i have also just found out that comments have to be    lines long  the whole point of these comments is to give an indication of whether the movie is worth watching  not write an essay gushing about it or taking it apart  if you like  seinfeld  larry sanders  the young ones  alan partridge  arrested development  curb  red dwarf  then you might like to pass on this  on the other hand  if you like lame jokes such as can be found in friends and dodgeball  enjoy watching this,0,
out of boredom and vast curiosity  i decided to check this show out today since my four year old niece loves it  i should have known that it was a show that only a four year old could like  the show was pretty bad   first of all  the show just wasn t funny  the laugh track went off at the most inappropriate times which was very annoying  especially since none of the jokes were funny  the laugh track went off at some point when the one kid who s the cameraman said  i m going to go polish my lense   how the hell is that funny  the parts in it  like meat drumming  that were supposed to be funny was just stupid to anyone who s over the age of eleven   now  i have a feeling that four year olds are not the target audience  however  since i have a four year old niece who watches it  this sort of thing concerned me while i was watching it  it doesn t show very good behavior  in the episode i was watching  it shows sam stealing carly s sandwich and pushing her down to the ground  just so carly can stand up and do the same thing back to her  i would not want to see my niece acting that rude  i also don t like the idea of two young girls having a web show where they give out personal information    if this was real  there would be freaks all over her   this show would probably be good and funny to someone who s eleven or younger  but anyone older than that  just stay away from it  i ll give this two stars since i guess i can see how it can be funny to a kid,0,
functioning as a sort of midpoint between  waiting for guffman  and  a mighty wind    best in show  portrays a dog show and the various people who bring their canine friends to participate  some are weird  some crazy  and otherwise  but they all make the movie good  director christopher guest is particularly funny as gay harlan pepper  very much trying to promote his dog  eugene levy  parker posey  michael mckean  catherine o hara  and bob balaban also do great jobs  i can t imagine them not doing great jobs  at least not in a christopher guest movie   as someone who s never attended a dog show  this movie is my main exposure to them  they sure look neat,1,
giorgino is a long  excruciating journey from bad to worse in the life of protagonist after whom the movie is named  young demobilized  gas poisoned first world war lieutenant of very delicate health  who previously was a doctor in an orphanage for children with some mental deprivations  goes in a search of their new location and finds much more than he ever intended to and quite of a different nature  depressive atmosphere of ultimate despair  where the insane ones are much less horrible than the sane  where the madness is a kind of poetry  will hold you hypnotized from the very first frames of this film to the last  and all the beauty  beauty of the winter and mountains  beauty of snowy landscapes and wild woods  i don t even know how all the sorrow and sadness of last days of war could be made so beautiful,1,
this show is a show that is great for adults and children to sit down together and watch  the stories are a little slow for adults but they are still good  there are lots of children in my family  boys and girls  and it is hard to get them all to agree on what to watch  but they always agree with each other when they want to watch the mystic knights  it is a wonderful show and i hope that they will continue to keep making it  all of the kids in my family and myself think that vincent walsh is the best of them all  we have seen that he has done lots of other work and think that he is doing a great job  we wish all of the actors  actresses  writers  directors  and producers the best of luck and would just like to say keep up the good work,1,
very good     s movie about mob operations in new jersey  when a  maverick  gangster doesn t play by the rules of the neighborhood  sooner or later  it s time for elimination   joe pesci was true to his character    smooth and funny  he only gets better with age  his face and present day fame should not have been used on the dvd cover to sell this  b  grade movie as he was only the third billed star   dated      s printed wide lapel shirts and lesser quality background music make for a distraction  nice to see the      s big cars    however  the acting is good    nakedness on the part of anne johns was not needed to make this mob story work  and  she does not show up in the database as every acting again in any film other than this one  too bad  she did a good job   moral of the story  don t get your  don  upset with you   if you are wanting to see something different when you wake up in the middle of the night then check out this dvd  it was part of a three movie on one dvd       special at the local discount store,1,
i remember ignoring the tv series when it first debuted because of its  look  with the jim hensen muppets  however  recently a friend let me borrow his farscape dvds  and i am just now realizing what a terrible mistake that was    as with any tv series  there are episodes that shine and those that don t  i ride the adrenaline and emotional rush during the great episodes and suffer through the lackluster ones  however  i endure regardless because of the core storyline that ties all the episodes together  what i m talking about is the growth of the main characters and their love for each other  let me warn you  it is something that is absolutely irresistible to watch  i cannot recall any other tv series  babylon    buffy  angel  etc  that smartly and intelligently put together such a heartbreaking  at times  and suspenseful ride   i think that at the end of the fourth season  things were finally becoming tightly focused and i am shocked at the decision to cancel the series  i wait anxiously for the release of the miniseries and invite others to discover this incredible gem,1,
lil pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp  the animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film   i laughed out loud for the first    minutes or so of this movie  mostly at the concept  after that  the joke wore thin  as a       minute animated short  lil pimp would have been a classic  instead  this movie consists entirely of one joke that lasts far too long   weathers  voiced by ludicrous  does have several crude and funny one liners  unfortunately  that is all the boy s pet rat is good for as he contributes nothing else to the story  eventually  i grew as bored with his remarks as i did the rest of this movie   i am a big fan of south park  and other animation aimed at adults  i also play several online pimp games  so i am partial to stories about pimps  the transition from little boy to lil pimp was brilliant  but after that  both the story and dialog became redundant and predictable   i give this movie a five  it is worth watching for the great concept and voice acting  just do not expect much else or you will be quite disappointed,0,
cooley high was actually a drama with moments of comedy  it was a reflection of high school life back in the day  i attended coolidge high in washington  d c  from      to      and much of what was in cooley high was an every day thing at coolidge  as a matter of fact after the movie came out everybody started calling coolidge  cooley high   getting high  shooting dice  chasing girls  basement parties  and fights  that sums up high school life for many in d c  back in the day  i can t forget motown because motown music began and ended many a day back in the   s  the hits just kept coming  however  cooley high adds a layer of humanity over the craziness because when all was said and done just like in cooley high my classmates and i had a lot of love for each other  and like the characters in cooley high there was life after high school  but there was nothing like waking up every morning and experiencing each day to the fullest from homeroom to seventh period  thirty years later we are getting ready to celebrate those good times  cooley high is definitely a period piece that just gets better with time because like it or not the only thing left from those days are memories  some good  and some bad,1,
curse of michael myers is a very frustrating piece to deal with for a fan of the halloween series  after a very disappointing letdown in halloween    the series reached a near ebb in plot lines  with a silly devolution into witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to the worship of michael myers   curse of michael myers  ups the ante in blood and gore  but really represents a decay in the series  integrity  it s too bad to  as this is the last movie for donald pleasance as the character of dr  loomis  pleasance has some good screen moments  precious ones if your a fan of the series  as the now very aged and as he says  very retired doctor   sadly he died before the movie was completed  and it is very apparent at the conclusion of the film that the stories original climatic scene was never realized  right from the beginning credits  halloween   has more of the feel of a made for tv movie then that of the block buster horror flick that it started out as in       any loyal halloween alumni should have demanded more from this film     dr  loomis and donald pleasance deserved more,0,
this is one of the finest movies i have ever seen    the stark scenery   the isolation   the ignorant bigoted people hiding behind their religion   a backdrop for some wordliness and sophistication   the acting is completely natural   but for me as a foodie  the best is the actual choosing and preparation of the feast  i have spent time in paris and know the cuisine well   whether or not the cafe anglais really exists i don t know but i do know of similar establishments and babette s menu and choice of wines are authentic   and of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal mellows them back to friendship is the only ending there could be  this is a    out of    film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it,1,
a jane smiley novel  loosely based on shakespeare s king lear about the cook family and its dark secrets  director moorhouse seems tamed in her approach  allowing the characters to step forward and take a bow  and how could you go wrong with the talents of pfeiffer  lange  leigh  firth  carradine and robards,1,
this movie was so incredibly boring  michael j  fox could ve done so much better  sorry  but it s true for all you people who liked the movie,0,
james franco is totally cool in this movie  not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way  at the tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole james dean thing but i don t think this true  blind spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent  in this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely  it s a unique performance  bittersweet and really moving  the lines from his journal cut you like a knife  you sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words  the tone is everything  he carries it through the action and suspense as well as the grim bits of gallows humor  i like the other two actors a great deal too  the blonde girl is totally gorgeous and the man is hysterical in his twisted tough guy stoicism  some of the thugs seemed a little sketchy but this is a mini point really  the film is totally solid and franco is way cool all around,1,
excellent and moving story of the end of a uniquely intimate affair  then again  the point of the film  to paraphrase another comment  is that every relationship can be unique and intimate  a truly quality short film which caught me at my busiest  yet had the power to pull me down onto the sofa and watch  fixed and quiet  for the duration  bobby and tessa are powerfully moving characters and anyone who has suffered the end of a love affair will find this film to be a cathartic exercise  beyond that  the  film within a film  idea plays out very well with this cast and is quite riveting  though in a somewhat melancholic way,1,
a  wacky chick  flick  a beauty contestant winds up dead and the usual suspects are rounded up  another entry in the vein of the texas cheerleader  this is an average example of its type   yasmine bleeth turns in her usual wholesome girl performance  and jill clayburgh does a good job as her stressed out slightly obsessed mom   some mildly funny moments listening to the vapid self serving pr coming out of contestants  mouths    i d like to own a restaurant so i can give left over food to the homeless     you have to ask yourself what people are using for brains when they think a cheerleader spot or beauty crown is worth killing for,0,
this is the kind of movie that you rent when you are incredibly tired  or impaired in some other way    the acting in this movie is so bad it seems intentional  and to let you know how bad the special effects are  there is one scene when the puppets are coming alive where you can see most of a hand holding the puppet  moving it about  the movie looked as if it was filmed with a camcorder  when i saw this movie for the first time  a fistfight nearly erupted when my friends and i were calling each other names from this flick  that s how terrible it was  if you enjoy getting mad at movies  i recommend this to you  otherwise  flee as though your very life depended on it,1,
onstage john osborne s adaptation of  picture of dorian gray  is a fine tribute to oscar wilde s talents as both novelist and playwright on screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of   crucial scenes from the play  one being an important scene between basil and henry showing that time has passed  the acting however is brilliant  sir john gielgud return s to his wilde roots as lord henry and although about a decade too old for the role he totally becomes the enigmatic life loving cad and cynic that wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella  jeremy brett is also strong offering a touching portrait of the anguished artist basil hallward peter firth while not originally my vision of dorian  handles the role with style and grace   and later with a convincing strain of cruelty  the supporting cast is equally fine  gielgud s former  importance of being earnest  co star gwen francon davies plays his philanthropic aunt agatha with dignity and judi bowker makes a touching sybil vane  the wit pathos and tension of wilde s work have been remarkably transferred to the screen  my only other qualm is with the hair styles  many of them seemed out of place looking more like      s versions of victorian hairdos rather than the actual style  overall however the acting and writing elevates this production to a high level of small screen excellence,1,
makes the fourth theatrical release  the one national lampoon took its name off of  look like a comedy classic  a complete mistake and a sad attempt to capitalize on a once proud franchise  painfully unfunny and unwatchable   even for a tv movie  the cousin eddie character has become progressively less amusing  from the original vacation when it was fresh and unique  through christmas vacation when it was starting to wear a bit thin  to vegas vacation where it was actually annoying to see come on screen  but  in fairness  there were a lot of things that were annoying to see come on screen in that movie    but this attempt to move the character up to lead status is unfortunate to say the least  the vacation movies themselves met an ugly death in las vegas  and this hope at reviving even the thinnest thread of the series for television was thoroughly misguided  chevy chase and company put together a great trilogy back when he was in his prime  now let s just pull the plug and let the title rest in peace   one tiny note of interest  the original audrey griswold  dana barron  the first of four actresses to play the part  including juliette lewis  returns to the role    years later  one is left only to wonder   why,0,
irvine welsh s follow up to trainspotting hits the screen as three short stories set in edinburgh  all with a few of welsh s trade marks  drug culture  depression  the working class and hibernian football club  uneasy to watch in places  it is no less than very well written    of the stories having a darkly comic twist to them while the  nd story a serious  and shockingly realistic  plot to it  will not appeal to most  including myself to a point  but will no doubt adopt a cult following,0,
in the early    s  i recorded honky tonk freeway from the cable  since then i have waited  hoping it would be on dvd  yesterday i found it  it is one of the best humorous character studies i ever saw  the old fashioned episode is priceless  at this time           only two have reviewed it  one hated it  the other loved it  if you have a dvd player  either rent it  or buy it as i did,1,
if sicily is a territory of the baroque  with its doubling of perspective  that s part of this movie s challenge to realism  and it s an exuberant pleasure here  outdoing fellini with not one but three film directors  plus of course the actual bellocchio  who has made some really great movies and shouldn t be touchy about his honor  there is a variety of takes and casting improvisations on manzoni s  i promessi sposi  with  somewhere there  actual marriage  sicily is also taken to be a territory of skulduggery  you already know this version of the island  so there s no spoiler involved   a comic version of which makes the picture worth seeing for sergio castellito s work with guard dogs on the floor of the great hall of a palazzo,1,
this was a get up and go horror movie with an intelligent cast and a director with great vision to really capture the mood of the story i highly recommend this movie,1,
in post civil war america the president   van johnson   travels to dallas and is assassinated by corrupt officials and businessman interested in installing the vice president whom they can blackmail due to incriminating documents  a gunman  guiliano gemma  convinced that his black friend is wrongly accused of the assassination aims to uncover the truth  tonino valeri directed this fascinating  if flawed film which obviously is an allegory for the kennedy assassination  the film may wrongly present blacks as slaves working on plantations in texas but the film is nonetheless enjoyable and presents an interesting interpretation   that kennedy s death was the result of a coup de tat  which many americans could not accept at the time  oswald s murder is replayed here as the black accused of the assassination is murdered by the men responsible  on route to fort worth prison  this moment in the film is more melodramatic than oswald s death with his various escorts shot down before his over the top death scene  nonetheless this is definitely one of the more interesting and worthwhile spaghetti westerns  worth a look,1,
first of all  the title  daily  is a lie    every  daily show  program opens with an on screen visual of the date it was made  followed by a pause and the opening announce  on the many days when they are re running a daily show  they slip cue the tape and omit the date and begin with the opening announce giving the false impression that the show is a new one  that s a lie  there is no mention of it being a rebroadcast  and that kind of crap is just a small indicator of how sneaky and deceptive this show is    furthermore  it s only on   nights a week  that s not quite  daily    meaning monday through friday   another shortcoming but one i am grateful for   it s sad to think that many clueless young people use this fake news program as their main  often only  news source  this leaves them woefully ignorant and much worse   badly misinformed   although it leans liberal left  politically  this show can be amusing at times  however  its veracity is low  facts and information are often cleverly twisted to fit the writers  agendas  it s often hard to tell where the facts leave off and the fiction and comedy writing begin  the result is pre digested  reinterpreted information designed to persuade and influence  this is called  propaganda    the remote interviews are heavily kluged in editing   it really loses me when it bashes god and christians   which it does all too often  however  you ll never hear anything vaguely anti semitic   if jon stewart and company attacked anyone but christians  it would be considered an offensive outrage  the names in the credits explain the source,0,
i am not a faulkner fan  which is considered sacrilegious  especially since i grew up near the author s hometown   however  i think this is an excellent movie  on par with the quality of the movie  to kill a mocking bird   if you haven t seen it  buy it anyway  it s well worth having in your permanent collection  tcm recently played the movie as a part of the race on film series  i wish they d play it more often  very moving   on a side note  the folks from oxford  mississippi  will also enjoy seeing the footage of the town square as it was back in the      s  the courthouse  city hall  etc   they re all on screen  i never knew the movie was filmed there until i noticed the familiarity of the buildings  when i saw the arch in the front of city hall  i began to get suspicious  look closely at the pennants on chick s wall  you ll see two for ole miss,1,
for a squadron leader   normally the only guy trained and equipped for navigation in a squadron and very hard to replace   to risk an expensive plane and himself to pick up a crashed fellow pilot  no matter how close a friend he is  in the face of oncoming enemy troops  is hard to believe  especially when they both have to share a cramped spitfire cockpit   two into a skyraider  ok  but a spit   come on  this part of the film is a biggles adventure  not fitting a film that one is supposed to take seriously  as said by tord s eriksson  gothenburg  sweden  is rubbish  not at all biggles  one true story of the war comes to mind of two grounded spit pilots  who planned and flew  illegally  a strafing mission over france  one had to crash land and his friend landed his spit under fire  while german infantry was moving in on them  and flew them both out of there  in a spit  they were both severely injured in former fights  one had an artificial leg from the knee down  now that may sound like something out of bigles  but it happened  ill get sources if needed,1,
once again  the posters lied to me   the marketing of this flick was deeply at odds with the content   explosive   when i read the synopsis for this movie  i was expecting to see a townful of grotesques  every man jack of them bloodshot and bloated by alcohol  peppered by heroin needles and bent double with chronic masturbation  into such a  den of vice  would come the clean shaven hero  shining gabriel  instead  the movie was the complete opposite of what i was led to expect   the first few minutes of the film showed us that middletown is a simple little place full of poor people doing the best they can  whether fiddling a little to make ends meet  drinking to forget the pain  or watching cock fighting  chickens  not penises  to while away the boredom  in other words  the townspeople were desperately ordinary   the only  deliberate   grotesque in the piece was gabriel  the brainwashed presbyterian preacher played by macfadyen  whose face is built in such a way as to suggest a permanent air of bewildered fury  if i were kind  i would suggest that the paisleyite rantings of the preacher were a witty comment designed to make us despise gabriel and his faith  unfortunately  brian kirk is so inept a film maker that you quickly despise everyone in the movie  leaving the audience to fret their way through eighty plus minutes of dark  hackneyed tedium  my only respite from this waste of celluloid was a game of  guess the accent  broken up with rounds of  spot the location   are we surprised that gaybo ends up stealing his brother s child and suffocating his father  of course not  he s a bible bashing preacher and therefore psychotic  all the townspeople stand around looking shocked at the end of the movie  but i suspect that they ve just realised what a turkey they ve put their names to   the northern ireland film and television commission have a budget to spend  but there are better projects than this feeble enterprise  the only kind thing i can say in favour of this movie is that it has managed to replace  superman returns  as the worst film of       one hell of an achievement   v           v,0,
a serial killer   carl stargher   has been kidnapping and murdering young women by letting them drown in a water filled cell   he is apprehended by the fbi   but is in a coma and his latest kidnap victim awaits in a cell timed to fill with water   take a look at the above premise and you ll see that there s a very much seen it all before look to it   the magic of mark protosevich s script is that he changes a hoary old chestnut plot in to something quite different from what you re expecting   if i mentioned the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter the mind of stargher then sets up a different film entirely   this wouldn  t be enough to make the cell a different class of thriller but director tarsem singh creates a visually striking surreal thriller   the cinematography by paul laufer where opaque primary colours are to the fore is stunning but singh doesn t let it end there   things like costume design where stargher wanders around his idiosyncratic universe wearing opulent costumes does have a visual impact making this so much more than a run of a mill thriller   what stops the cell becoming a classic movie however is that you start becoming more and more aware that the whole movie revolves around the visuals rather than having a natural narrative   we see a third character   a fbi man enter stargher s domain but this seems more like a contrived plot turn just to introduce the audience to more stunning but very disturbing moments  it should also be pointed out that this is a rather disturbing thriller with a atmosphere that is very depressing and that stops the film from being if not enjoyable   then involving   one scene where a fbi agent recounts a case where a paedophile beats a rap only to later cut out the heart of his victim will fill your heart with so much despair you might reach for the off button   you ll probably have to watch a massive amount of thrillers till you see another one as disconcerting as this one,1,
this is a pale imitation of  officer and a gentleman   there is no chemistry between kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest  the dialog is wooden  the situations hackneyed  it s too long and the climax is anti climactic     i love the uscg  its men and women are fearless and tough  the action scenes are awesome  but this movie doesn t do much for recruiting  i fear  the script is formulaic  but confusing  kutcher s character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasn t his fault  costner s is raging against the dying of the light  but why  his  conflict  with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle  i saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt i got my money s worth,0,
a good entertainment but nothing more   in this western we are between the classics and the spaghetti ones  this provides us a good a conventional story but it s always a pleasure to see robert mitchum with his legendary flegma although he isn t as fit as in the forties or the fifties  and don t forget david carradine is the son of john carradine,1,
i went to see this movie tonight  trying to keep an open mind  i had hoped to enjoy a movie that i expected to be different from the book  there were considerable differences from the book  much like the changes made in the divinci code  i went to see the divinci code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film  in spite of  the changes from the book  it was still enjoyable  filled with action  and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating  unfortunately  angels and demons disappointed on almost every level  throughout the movie  symbols are found and figured out quickly  without any interest for the viewer  they blow past the various immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work  the final illuminati symbol  which was the most interesting and creative one in the book  was replaced with the crossed keys symbol  in my opinion  that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols  which is what the langdon character is all about  overall  this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book  and fails at the attempt to be an action movie   thriller    out of,0,
there was nothing else on tv yesterday afternoon  so i thought  okay  let s watch this   i didn t know the plot and i had no expectation whatsoever  i was thinking in a few minutes or so i will channel surf again  but then story started to unfold  and the characters played beautifully by the two boys  the story did have unrealistic parts and scenes  but overall it was a real good movie  very well worth watching,1,
many people remember the waco standoff that occurred a long time ago  what most people probably have ingrained in their minds is the  cult leader  david koresh and the images of the compound burning to the ground after a long standoff  a lot of people have the belief that koresh was some kind of madman who thought he was god  he was accused of being a child molester and was credited for the breakdown and deaths of his followers  furthermore  many people feel the cult committed mass suicide when the fbi stormed mount carmel center and when the building was burning  most people feel the cult was at fault for not agreeing with the fbi on reasonable terms  most people feel the cult was brainwashed by koresh and followed along with everything that he said  nothing could be farther from the truth  because of strong evidence after the nightmare was over  and this one of  a  kind documentary pretty much proves it     this documentary is one of the most balanced examinations at the situation that occurred  it is much more thorough and highly detailed than anything most people have received in the mainstream media  to the shock of many people  this documentary will reveal that is was the atf  the fbi  and the higher levels of the united states government who were the ones who were unjust  cruel  and deceptive  and not david koresh and his followers  what korseh and davidians were doing was just protecting their constitutional rights  and the higher powers completely violated and raped those rights  the aft had no grounds to storm the compound  it was the aft that shot first and they shot from the helicopters from above at unarmed men  women  and children   what is even more shocking is the actions of the fbi when they entered the mount carmel  watch it for yourselves and you will develop and new perspective on the u s  government  there is infrared footage that clearly shows the fbi was shooting with machine guns at the men  women  and children in the burning compound  it will make your blood boil  it will make you really angry  it will make you wonder as to what kind of people run this country  finally  it will make you wonder as to what you are being told on the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth  this video is frightening and i highly recommend it if one can find it  this documentary does not need to be purchased  it can be watched for free on google video,1,
i try to catch this film each time it s shown on tv  which happily is quite often  but i keep forgetting to video it  as it is  i practically know the script by heart  but that doesn t stop me having a good cry  in fact it probably adds to it as i cry knowing what s coming next  it s such a lovely film   well made  well cast  good photography  i love it  one of my top ten films,1,
there s no use trying to describe in detail the convoluted  overly melodramatic plot involving civil war bitterness  a crooked town boss  and other complications  it s all bad   stella stevens  andrew prine  bo svenson  william smith  tim thomerson and lee majors are all good actors that may not be big stars  or big stars anymore  but always made fun movies   here  they re all wasted on a picture that looks like it was shot in a wild west tourist trap  with costumes borrowed from the local high school theater department  in fact  most of the acting appears to be on the high school level too  which might not be so bad if it weren t so pretentious   the name of ed wood is invoked way too lightly these days  i think in this case the comparison is warranted  however  i suspect that old ed would have made a more entertaining western than this,0,
i know i loved this movie when i was       years old  now that i am    i watched it again  and i wished i hadn t  because all the things i laughed at when i was younger  is no longer funny  so this is an hour and a half without fun  for me the jokes were lame  not funny or just too childish  so the same thing i loved about the movie when i was a kid  is now the things i don t like about it  besides not being funny it is not actually believable at all  the evil character is very poorly done but i guess that is the kind of movie it is  and the last    minutes of the movie is pretty lame with bad fighting sequences and so on    but if you are young you will probably love it  i rate this movie,0,
